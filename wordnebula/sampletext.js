SampleText.declaration = "The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America  When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.  97 Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct  object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and  necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate  and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.  He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.  He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislature.  He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:  For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:  For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world: For imposing taxes on us without our consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by  jury: For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended  offenses: For abolishing the free system of English laws in a  neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule in these colonies:  For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:  For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totaly unworth the head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the  high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.  We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levey war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the  protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor."

SampleText.littlePrince = "Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal Here is a copy of the drawing  In the book it said: Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing My Drawing Number One It looked something like this:  I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them But they answered: Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat? My drawing was not a picture of a hat It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly They always need to have things explained My Drawing Number Two looked like this:  The grown-ups response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence I have lived a great deal among grown-ups I have seen them intimately, close at hand And that hasnt much improved my opinion of them Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: That is a hat Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars I would bring myself down to his level I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man II So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago Something was broken in my engine And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice It said: If you please 97 draw me a sheep! What! Draw me a sheep! I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck I blinked my eyes hard I looked carefully all around me And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model  That, however, is not my fault The grown-ups discouraged me in my painters career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: But 97 what are you doing here? And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: If you please 97 draw me a sheep When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw He answered me: That doesnt matter Draw me a sheep But I had never drawn a sheep So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with: No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome Where I live, everything is very small What I need is a sheep Draw me a sheep So then I made a drawing  He looked at it carefully, then he said: No This sheep is already very sickly Make me another So I made another drawing  My friend smiled gently and indulgently You see yourself, he said, that this is not a sheep This is a ram It has horns So then I did my drawing over once more  But it was rejected too, just like the others This one is too old I want a sheep that will live a long time By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart So I tossed off this drawing And I threw out an explanation with it This is only his box The sheep you asked for is inside  I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge: That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass? Why? Because where I live everything is very small There will surely be enough grass for him, I said It is a very small sheep that I have given you He bent his head over the drawing Not so small that 97 Look! He has gone to sleep And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince III  It took me a long time to learn where he came from The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: What is that object? That is not an object It flies It is an airplane It is my airplane And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly He cried out, then: What! You dropped down from the sky? Yes, I answered, modestly Oh! That is funny! And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously Then he added: So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet? At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: Do you come from another planet? But he did not reply He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: It is true that on that you cant have come from very far away And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the other planets I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject My little man, where do you come from? What is this where I live, of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep? After a reflective silence he answered: The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house That is so And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: Tie him! What a queer idea! But if you dont tie him, I said, he will wander off somewhere, and get lost My friend broke into another peal of laughter: But where do you think he would go? Anywhere Straight ahead of him Then the little prince said, earnestly: That doesnt matter Where I live, everything is so small! And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far IV I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house! But that did not really surprise me much I knew very well that in addition to the great planets 97 such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus 97 to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number He might call it, for example, Asteroid 325  I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612 This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909  On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said Grown-ups are like that Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance And this time everybody accepted his report  If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters They never say to you, What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies? Instead, they demand: How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make? Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him If you were to say to the grown-ups: I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof, they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all You would have to say to them: I saw a house that cost $20,000 Then they would exclaim: Oh, what a pretty house that is! Just so, you might say to them: The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child But if you said to them: The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612, then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions They are like that One must not hold it against them Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales I should have like to say: Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him To forget a friend is sad Not every one has had a friend And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible But I am not at all sure of success One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject I make some errors, too, in the little princes height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also But that is something that will not be my fault My friend never explained anything to me He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups I have had to grow old V As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little princes planet, his departure from it, his journey The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it For the little prince asked me abruptly 97 as if seized by a grave doubt 97 It is true, isnt it, that sheep eat little bushes? Yes, that is true Ah! I am glad! I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes But the little prince added: Then it follows that they also eat baobabs? I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh We would have to put them one on top of the other, he said  But he made a wise comment: Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little That is strictly correct, I said But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs? He answered me at once, Oh, come, come!, as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived 97 as on all planets 97 good plants and bad plants In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants But seeds are invisible They sleep deep in the heart of the earths darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin 97 timidly at first 97 to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab The soil of that planet was infested with them A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late It spreads over the entire planet It bores clear through it with its roots And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces  It is a question of discipline, the little prince said to me later on When youve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth It is very tedious work, the little prince added, but very easy And one day he said to me: You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day Sometimes, he added, there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man He neglected three little bushes So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve Children, I say plainly, watch out for the baobabs! My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me Perhaps you will ask me, Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs? The reply is simple I have tried But with the others I have not been successful When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity  VI Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: I am very fond of sunsets Come, let us go look at a sunset now But we must wait, I said Wait? For what? For the sunset We must wait until it is time At first you seemed to be very much surprised And then you laughed to yourself You said to me: I am always thinking that I am at home! Just so Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon Unfortunately, France is too far away for that But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like One day, you said to me, I saw the sunset forty-four times! And a little later you added: You know 97 one loves the sunset, when one is so sad Were you so sad, then? I asked, on the day of the forty-four sunsets? But the little prince made no reply  VII On the fifth day 97 again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep 97 the secret of the little princes life was revealed to me Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded: A sheep 97 if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too? A sheep, I answered, eats anything it finds in its reach Even flowers that have thorns? Yes, even flowers that have thorns Then the thorns 97 what use are they? I did not know At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst The thorns 97 what use are they? The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it As for me, I was upset over that bolt And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: The thorns are of no use at all Flowers have thorns just for spite! Oh! There was a moment of complete silence Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: I dont believe you! Flowers are weak creatures They are naefve They reassure themselves as best they can They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons I did not answer At that instant I was saying to myself: If this bolt still wont turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts: And you actually believe that the flowers 97  Oh, no! I cried No, no, no! I dont believe anything I answered you with the first thing that came into my head Dont you see 97 I am very busy with matters of consequence! He stared at me, thunderstruck Matters of consequence! He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly You talk just like the grown-ups! That made me a little ashamed But he went on, relentlessly: You mix everything up together You confuse everything He was really very angry He tossed his golden curls in the breeze I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman He has never smelled a flower He has never looked at a star He has never loved any one He has never done anything in his life but add up figures And all day he says over and over, just like you: I am busy with matters of consequence! And that makes him swell up with pride But he is not a man 97 he is a mushroom! A what? A mushroom! The little prince was now white with rage The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentlemans sums? And if I know 97 I, myself 97 one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing 97 Oh! You think that is not important!  His face turned from white to red as he continued: If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars He can say to himself, Somewhere, my flower is there But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened And you think that is not important! He could not say anything more His words were choked by sobbing The night had fallen I had let my tools drop from my hands Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted I took him in my arms, and rocked him I said to him: The flower that you love is not in danger I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep I will draw you a railing to put around your flower I will 97  I did not know what to say to him I felt awkward and blundering I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more It is such a secret place, the land of tears VIII I soon learned to know this flower better On the little princes planet the flowers had always been very simple They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber She chose her colors with the greatest care She dressed herself slowly She adjusted her petals one by one She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days  Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: Ah! I am scarcely awake I beg that you will excuse me My petals are still all disarranged But the little prince could not restrain his admiration: Oh! How beautiful you are! Am I not? the flower responded, sweetly And I was born at the same moment as the sun The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest 97 but how moving 97 and exciting 97 she was! I think it is time for breakfast, she added an instant later If you would have the kindness to think of my needs 97   And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water So, he tended the flower So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity 97 which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: Let the tigers come with their claws!  There are no tigers on my planet, the little prince objected And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds I am not a weed, the flower replied, sweetly Please excuse me I am not at all afraid of tigers, she went on, but I have a horror of drafts I suppose you wouldnt have a screen for me?  A horror of drafts 97 that is bad luck, for a plant, remarked the little prince, and added to himself, This flower is a very complex creature At night I want you to put me under a glass globe It is very cold where you live In the place I came from 97  But she interrupted herself at that point She had come in the form of a seed She could not have known anything of any other worlds Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naefve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong The screen? I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy  I ought not to have listened to her, he confided to me one day One never ought to listen to the flowers One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance Mine perfumed all my planet But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity And he continued his confidences: The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me I ought never to have run away from her I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her 85 IX  I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning He also had one volcano that was extinct But, as he said, One never knows! So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs He believed that he would never want to return But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears  Goodbye, he said to the flower But she made no answer Goodbye, he said again The flower coughed But it was not because she had a cold I have been silly, she said to him, at last I ask your forgiveness Try to be happy He was surprised by this absence of reproaches He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air He did not understand this quiet sweetness Of course I love you, the flower said to him It is my fault that you have not known it all the while That is of no importance But you 97 you have been just as foolish as I Try to be happy Let the glass globe be I dont want it any more But the wind 97  My cold is not so bad as all that The cool night air will do me good I am a flower But the animals 97  Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies It seems that they are very beautiful And if not the butterflies 97 and the caterpillars 97 who will call upon me? You will be far away As for the large animals 97 I am not at all afraid of any of them I have my claws And, naefvely, she showed her four thorns Then she added: Dont linger like this You have decided to go away Now go! For she did not want him to see her crying She was such a proud flower X He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330 He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge The first of them was inhabited by a king Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic  Ah! Here is a subject, exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming And the little prince asked himself: How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before? He did not know how the world is simplified for kings To them, all men are subjects Approach, so that I may see you better, said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the kings magnificent ermine robe So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king, the monarch said to him I forbid you to do so I cant help it I cant stop myself, replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep Ah, then, the king said I order you to yawn It is years since I have seen anyone yawning Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order That frightens me I cannot, any more murmured the little prince, now completely abashed Hum! Hum! replied the king Then I 97 I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to 97  He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected He tolerated no disobedience He was an absolute monarch But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable If I ordered a general, he would say, by way of example, if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general It would be my fault May I sit down? came now a timid inquiry from the little prince I order you to do so, the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle But the little prince was wondering The planet was tiny Over what could this king really rule? Sire, he said to him, I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question 97  I order you to ask me a question, the king hastened to assure him Sire 97 over what do you rule? Over everything, said the king, with magnificent simplicity Over everything? The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars Over all that? asked the little prince Over all that, the king answered For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal And the stars obey you? Certainly they do, the king said They obey instantly I do not permit insubordination Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor: I should like to see a sunset Do me that kindness Order the sun to set If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong? the king demanded The general, or myself? You, said the little prince firmly Exactly One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform, the king went on Accepted authority rests first of all on reason If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable Then my sunset? the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it You shall have your sunset I shall command it But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable When will that be? inquired the little prince Hum! Hum! replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac Hum! Hum! That will be about 97 about 97 that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight And you will see how well I am obeyed! The little prince yawned He was regretting his lost sunset And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored I have nothing more to do here, he said to the king So I shall set out on my way again Do not go, said the king, who was very proud of having a subject Do not go I will make you a Minister! Minister of what? Minster of 97 of Justice! But there is nobody here to judge! We do not know that, the king said to him I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom I am very old There is no room here for a carriage And it tires me to walk Oh, but I have looked already! said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all Then you shall judge yourself, the king answered that is the most difficult thing of all It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom Yes, said the little prince, but I can judge myself anywhere I do not need to live on this planet Hum! Hum! said the king I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat I hear him at night You can judge this old rat From time to time you will condemn him to death Thus his life will depend on your justice But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily He is the only one we have I, replied the little prince, do not like to condemn anyone to death And now I think I will go on my way No, said the king But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed, he said, he should be able to give me a reasonable order He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute It seems to me that conditions are favorable As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment Then, with a sigh, he took his leave I make you my Ambassador, the king called out, hastily He had a magnificent air of authority The grown-ups are very strange, the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey XI  The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer! he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers Good morning, said the little prince That is a queer hat you are wearing It is a hat for salutes, the conceited man replied It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way Yes? said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about Clap your hands, one against the other, the conceited man now directed him The little prince clapped his hands The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute This is more entertaining than the visit to the king, the little prince said to himself And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other The conceited man again raised his hat in salute After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the games monotony And what should one do to make the hat come down? he asked But the conceited man did not hear him Conceited people never hear anything but praise Do you really admire me very much? he demanded of the little prince What does that mean 97 admire? To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet But you are the only man on your planet! Do me this kindness Admire me just the same I admire you, said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, but what is there in that to interest you so much? And the little prince went away The grown-ups are certainly very odd, he said to himself, as he continued on his journey XII  The next planet was inhabited by a tippler This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection What are you doing there? he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles I am drinking, replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air Why are you drinking? demanded the little prince So that I may forget, replied the tippler Forget what? inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him Forget that I am ashamed, the tippler confessed, hanging his head Ashamed of what? insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him Ashamed of drinking! The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence And the little prince went away, puzzled The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd, he said to himself, as he continued on his journey XIII The fourth planet belonged to a businessman This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little princes arrival  Good morning, the little prince said to him Your cigarette has gone out Three and two make five Five and seven make twelve Twelve and three make fifteen Good morning Fifteen and seven make twenty-two Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight I havent time to light it again Twenty-six and five make thirty-one Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one Five hundred million what? asked the little prince Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million 97 I cant stop I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence I dont amuse myself with balderdash Two and five make seven Five-hundred-and-one million what? repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it The businessman raised his head During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism I dont get enough exercise I have no time for loafing The third time 97 well, this is it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions 97  Millions of what? The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question Millions of those little objects, he said, which one sometimes sees in the sky Flies? Oh, no Little glittering objects Bees? Oh, no Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence There is no time for idle dreaming in my life Ah! You mean the stars? Yes, thats it The stars And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars? Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate And what do you do with these stars? What do I do with them? Yes Nothing I own them You own the stars? Yes But I have already seen a king who 97  Kings do not own, they reign over It is a very different matter And what good does it do you to own the stars? It does me the good of making me rich And what good does it do you to be rich? It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered This man, the little prince said to himself, reasons a little like my poor tippler Nevertheless, he still had some more questions How is it possible for one to own the stars? To whom do they belong? the businessman retorted, peevishly I dont know To nobody Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it Is that all that is necessary? Certainly When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them Yes, that is true, said the little prince And what do you do with them? I administer them, replied the businessman I count them and recount them It is difficult But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence The little prince was still not satisfied If I owned a silk scarf, he said, I could put it around my neck and take it away with me If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven No But I can put them in the bank Whatever does that mean? That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key And that is all? That is enough, said the businessman It is entertaining, thought the little prince It is rather poetic But it is of no great consequence On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups I myself own a flower, he continued his conversation with the businessman, which I water every day I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows) It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them But you are of no use to the stars The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer And the little prince went away The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary, he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey XIV  The fifth planet was very strange It was the smallest of all There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house But he said to himself, nevertheless: It may well be that this man is absurd But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler For at least his work has some meaning When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep That is a beautiful occupation And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter Good morning Why have you just put out your lamp? Those are the orders, replied the lamplighter Good morning What are the orders? The orders are that I put out my lamp Good evening And he lighted his lamp again But why have you just lighted it again? Those are the orders, replied the lamplighter I do not understand, said the little prince There is nothing to understand, said the lamplighter Orders are orders Good morning And he put out his lamp Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares I follow a terrible profession In the old days it was reasonable I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep And the orders have been changed since that time? The orders have not been changed, said the lamplighter That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed! Then what? asked the little prince Then 97 the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out! That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live! It is not funny at all! said the lamplighter While we have been talking together a month has gone by A month? Yes, a month Thirty minutes Thirty days Good evening And he lighted his lamp again As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend You know, he said, I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to I always want to rest, said the lamplighter For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time The little prince went on with his explanation: Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly When you want to rest, you will walk 97 and the day will last as long as you like That doesnt do me much good, said the lamplighter The one thing I love in life is to sleep Then youre unlucky, said the little prince I am unlucky, said the lamplighter Good morning And he put out his lamp That man, said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend But his planet is indeed too small There is no room on it for two people What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets! XV  The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books Oh, look! Here is an explorer! he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little He had already traveled so much and so far! Where do you come from? the old gentleman said to him What is that big book? said the little prince What are you doing? I am a geographer, said the old gentleman What is a geographer? asked the little prince A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts That is very interesting, said the little prince Here at last is a man who has a real profession! And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen Your planet is very beautiful, he said Has it any oceans? I couldnt tell you, said the geographer Ah! The little prince was disappointed Has it any mountains? I couldnt tell you, said the geographer And towns, and rivers, and deserts? I couldnt tell you that, either But you are a geographer! Exactly, the geographer said But I am not an explorer I havent a single explorer on my planet It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts The geographer is much too important to go loafing about He does not leave his desk But he receives the explorers in his study He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorers moral character Why is that? Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer So would an explorer who drank too much Why is that? asked the little prince Because intoxicated men see double Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one I know some one, said the little prince, who would make a bad explorer That is possible Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery One goes to see it? No That would be too complicated But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement But you 97 you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me! And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink Well? said the geographer expectantly Oh, where I live, said the little prince, it is not very interesting It is all so small I have three volcanoes Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct But one never knows One never knows, said the geographer I have also a flower We do not record flowers, said the geographer Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet! We do not record them, said the geographer, because they are ephemeral What does that mean 97 ephemeral? Geographies, said the geographer, are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence They never become old-fashioned It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters We write of eternal things But extinct volcanoes may come to life again, the little prince interrupted What does that mean 97 ephemeral? Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us, said the geographer The thing that matters to us is the mountain It does not change But what does that mean 97 ephemeral? repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it It means, which is in danger of speedy disappearance Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance? Certainly it is My flower is ephemeral, the little prince said to himself, and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world And I have left her on my planet, all alone! That was his first moment of regret But he took courage once more What place would you advise me to visit now? he asked The planet Earth, replied the geographer It has a good reputation And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower XVI So then the seventh planet was the Earth The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men 97 that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage It would be magnificent Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole 97 only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year XVII When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that They imagine that they fill a great deal of space They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations They adore figures, and that will please them But do not waste your time on this extra task It is unnecessary You have, I know, confidence in me  When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand Good evening, said the little prince courteously Good evening, said the snake What planet is this on which I have come down? asked the little prince This is the Earth; this is Africa, the snake answered Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth? This is the desert There are no people in the desert The Earth is large, said the snake The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky I wonder, he said, whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again Look at my planet It is right there above us But how far away it is! It is beautiful, the snake said What has brought you here? I have been having some trouble with a flower, said the little prince Ah! said the snake And they were both silent  Where are the men? the little prince at last took up the conversation again It is a little lonely in the desert It is also lonely among men, the snake said The little prince gazed at him for a long time You are a funny animal, he said at last You are no thicker than a finger But I am more powerful than the finger of a king, said the snake The little prince smiled You are not very powerful You havent even any feet You cannot even travel I can carry you farther than any ship could take you, said the snake He twined himself around the little princes ankle, like a golden bracelet Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came, the snake spoke again But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star The little prince made no reply You move me to pity 97 you are so weak on this Earth made of granite, the snake said I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet I can 97  Oh! I understand you very well, said the little prince But why do you always speak in riddles? I solve them all, said the snake And they were both silent XVIII  The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all Good morning, said the little prince Good morning, said the flower Where are the men? the little prince asked, politely The flower had once seen a caravan passing Men? she echoed I think there are six or seven of them in existence I saw them, several years ago But one never knows where to find them The wind blows them away They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult Goodbye, said the little prince Goodbye, said the flower XIX After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool From a mountain as high as this one, he said to himself, I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people  But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles Good morning, he said courteously Good morning 97 Good morning 97 Good morning, answered the echo Who are you? said the little prince Who are you 97 Who are you 97 Who are you? answered the echo Be my friends I am all alone, he said I am all alone 97 all alone 97 all alone, answered the echo What a queer planet! he thought It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding And the people have no imagination They repeat whatever one says to them On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak XX But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road And all roads lead to the abodes of men Good morning, he said He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses Good morning, said the roses The little prince gazed at them They all looked like his flower Who are you? he demanded, thunderstruck We are roses, the roses said And he was overcome with sadness His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!  She would be very much annoyed, he said to himself, if she should see that She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life 97 for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die Then he went on with his reflections: I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees 97 and one of them perhaps extinct forever That doesnt make me a very great prince And he lay down in the grass and cried  XXI It was then that the fox appeared Good morning, said the fox Good morning, the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing I am right here, the voice said, under the apple tree  Who are you? asked the little prince, and added, You are very pretty to look at I am a fox, the fox said Come and play with me, proposed the little prince I am so unhappy I cannot play with you, the fox said I am not tamed Ah! Please excuse me, said the little prince But, after some thought, he added: What does that mean 97 tame? You do not live here, said the fox What is it that you are looking for? I am looking for men, said the little prince What does that mean 97 tame? Men, said the fox They have guns, and they hunt It is very disturbing They also raise chickens These are their only interests Are you looking for chickens? No, said the little prince I am looking for friends What does that mean 97 tame? It is an act too often neglected, said the fox It means to establish ties To establish ties? Just that, said the fox To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys And I have no need of you And you, on your part, have no need of me To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes But if you tame me, then we shall need each other To me, you will be unique in all the world To you, I shall be unique in all the world I am beginning to understand, said the little prince There is a flower I think that she has tamed me It is possible, said the fox On the Earth one sees all sorts of things Oh, but this is not on the Earth! said the little prince  The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious On another planet? Yes Are there hunters on that planet? No Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens? No Nothing is perfect, sighed the fox But he came back to his idea My life is very monotonous, the fox said I hunt chickens; men hunt me All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike And, in consequence, I am a little bored But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread Wheat is of no use to me The wheat fields have nothing to say to me And that is sad But you have hair that is the color of gold Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time Please 97 tame me! he said I want to, very much, the little prince replied But I have not much time I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand One only understands the things that one tames, said the fox Men have no more time to understand anything They buy things all ready made at the shops But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more If you want a friend, tame me What must I do, to tame you? asked the little prince You must be very patient, replied the fox First you will sit down at a little distance from me 97 like that 97 in the grass I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing Words are the source of misunderstandings But you will sit a little closer to me, every day The next day the little prince came back  It would have been better to come back at the same hour, said the fox If, for example, you come at four oclock in the afternoon, then at three oclock I shall begin to be happy I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances At four oclock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you One must observe the proper rites What is a rite? asked the little prince Those also are actions too often neglected, said the fox They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours There is a rite, for example, among my hunters Every Thursday they dance with the village girls So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all So the little prince tamed the fox And when the hour of his departure drew near 97 Ah, said the fox, I shall cry It is your own fault, said the little prince I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you Yes, that is so, said the fox But now you are going to cry! said the little prince Yes, that is so, said the fox Then it has done you no good at all! It has done me good, said the fox, because of the color of the wheat fields And then he added: Go and look again at the roses You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret The little prince went away, to look again at the roses You are not at all like my rose, he said As yet you are nothing No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one You are like my fox when I first knew him He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world And the roses were very much embarrassed You are beautiful, but you are empty, he went on One could not die for you To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you 97 the rose that belongs to me But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing Because she is my rose And he went back to meet the fox Goodbye, he said Goodbye, said the fox And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye What is essential is invisible to the eye, the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important It is the time I have wasted for my rose 97  said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember Men have forgotten this truth, said the fox But you must not forget it You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed You are responsible for your rose I am responsible for my rose, the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember XXII Good morning, said the little prince Good morning, said the railway switchman What do you do here? the little prince asked I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand , said the switchman I send off the trains that carry them: now to the right, now to the left And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchmans cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder They are in a great hurry, said the little prince What are they looking for? Not even the locomotive engineer knows that, said the switchman And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction Are they coming back already? demanded the little prince These are not the same ones, said the switchman It is an exchange Were they not satisfied where they were? asked the little prince No one is ever satisfied where he is, said the switchman And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express Are they pursuing the first travelers? demanded the little prince They are pursuing nothing at all, said the switchman They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes Only the children know what they are looking for, said the little prince They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry They are lucky, the switchman said XXIII Good morning, said the little prince Good morning, said the merchant This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink Why are you selling those? asked the little prince Because they save a tremendous amount of time, said the merchant Computations have been made by experts With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes? Anything you like As for me, said the little prince to himself, if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water  XXIV It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply Ah, I said to the little prince, these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water! My friend the fox 97  the little prince said to me My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox! Why not? Because I am about to die of thirst He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend He has no way of guessing the danger, I said to myself He has never been either hungry or thirsty A little sunshine is all he needs But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: I am thirsty, too Let us look for a well I made a gesture of weariness It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert But nevertheless we started walking When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream The little princes last words came reeling back into my memory: Then you are thirsty, too? I demanded But he did not reply to my question He merely said to me: Water may also be good for the heart I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him He was tired He sat down I sat down beside him And, after a little silence, he spoke again: The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen I replied, Yes, that is so And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight The desert is beautiful, the little prince added And that was true I have always loved the desert One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams What makes the desert beautiful, said the little prince, is that somewhere it hides a well I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it But it cast an enchantment over that house My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart Yes, I said to the little prince The house, the stars, the desert 97 what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible! I am glad, he said, that you agree with my fox As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more I felt deeply moved, and stirred It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: What I see here is nothing but a shell What is most important is invisible As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower 97 the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep And I felt him to be more fragile still I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak XXV Men, said the little prince, set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round And he added: It is not worth the trouble The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand This one was like a well in a village But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming It is strange, I said to the little prince Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten  Do you hear? said the little prince We have wakened the well, and it is singing I did not want him to tire himself with the rope Leave it to me, I said It is too heavy for you I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there 97 happy, tired as I was, over my achievement The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water I am thirsty for this water, said the little prince Give me some of it to drink And I understood what he had been looking for I raised the bucket to his lips He drank, his eyes closed It was as sweet as some special festival treat This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms It was good for the heart, like a present When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received The men where you live, said the little prince, raise five thousand roses in the same garden 97 and they do not find in it what they are looking for They do not find it, I replied And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water Yes, that is true, I said And the little prince added: But the eyes are blind One must look with the heart I had drunk the water I breathed easily At sunrise the sand is the color of honey And that honey color was making me happy, too What brought me, then, this sense of grief? You must keep your promise, said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more What promise? You know 97 a muzzle for my sheep I am responsible for this flower I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said: Your baobabs 97 they look a little like cabbages Oh! I had been so proud of my baobabs! Your fox 97 his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long And he laughed again You are not fair, little prince, I said I dont know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside Oh, that will be all right, he said, children understand So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle And as I gave it to him my heart was torn You have plans that I do not know about, I said But he did not answer me He said to me, instead: You know 97 my descent to the earth Tomorrow will be its anniversary Then, after a silence, he went on: I came down very near here And he flushed And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow One question, however, occurred to me: Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you 97 a week ago 97 you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed? The little prince flushed again And I added, with some hesitancy: Perhaps it was because of the anniversary? The little prince flushed once more He never answered questions 97 but when one flushes does that not mean Yes? Ah, I said to him, I am a little frightened 97  But he interrupted me Now you must work You must return to your engine I will be waiting for you here Come back tomorrow evening But I was not reassured I remembered the fox One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed XXVI Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling And I heard him say: Then you dont remember This is not the exact spot Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place I continued my walk toward the wall At no time did I see or hear anyone The little prince, however, replied once again:  97 Exactly You will see where my track begins, in the sand You have nothing to do but wait for me there I shall be there tonight I was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing After a silence the little prince spoke again: You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long? I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand Now go away, said the little prince I want to get down from the wall  I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall 97 and I leaped into the air There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow What does this mean? I demanded Why are you talking with snakes? I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink And now I did not dare ask him any more questions He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someones rifle I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine, he said Now you can go back home 97  How do you know about that? I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope He made no answer to my question, but he added:  I, too, am going back home today Then, sadly 97 It is much farther It is much more difficult I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him His look was very serious, like some one lost far away I have your sheep And I have the sheeps box And I have the muzzle And he gave me a sad smile I waited a long time I could see that he was reviving little by little Dear little man, I said to him, you are afraid He was afraid, there was no doubt about that But he laughed lightly I shall be much more afraid this evening Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert Little man, I said, I want to hear you laugh again But he said to me: Tonight, it will be a year My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago Little man, I said, tell me that it is only a bad dream 97 this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star But he did not answer my plea He said to me, instead: The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen Yes, I know It is just as it is with the flower If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night All the stars are a-bloom with flowers Yes, I know It is just as it is with the water Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music You remember 97 how good it was Yes, I know And at night you will look up at the stars Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found It is better, like that My star will just be one of the stars, for you And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens they will all be your friends And, besides, I am going to make you a present He laughed again Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter! That is my present Just that It will be as it was when we drank the water What are you trying to say? All men have the stars, he answered, but they are not the same things for different people For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides For others they are no more than little lights in the sky For others, who are scholars, they are problems For my businessman they were wealth But all these stars are silent You 97 you alone 97 will have the stars as no one else has them 97  What are you trying to say? In one of the stars I shall be living In one of them I shall be laughing And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night You 97 only you 97 will have stars that can laugh! And he laughed again And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me You will always be my friend You will want to laugh with me And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, Yes, the stars always make me laugh! And they will think you are crazy It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you And he laughed again It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh And he laughed again Then he quickly became serious: Tonight 97 you know Do not come I shall not leave you, I said I shall look as if I were suffering I shall look a little as if I were dying It is like that Do not come to see that It is not worth the trouble I shall not leave you But he was worried I tell you 97 it is also because of the snake He must not bite you Snakes 97 they are malicious creatures This one might bite you just for fun I shall not leave you But a thought came to reassure him: It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite That night I did not see him set out on his way He got away from me without making a sound When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step He said to me merely: Ah! You are there And he took me by the hand But he was still worrying It was wrong of you to come You will suffer I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true I said nothing You understand it is too far I cannot carry this body with me It is too heavy I said nothing But it will be like an old abandoned shell There is nothing sad about old shells I said nothing He was a little discouraged But he made one more effort: You know, it will be very nice I, too, shall look at the stars All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink I said nothing That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water  And he too said nothing more, because he was crying Here it is Let me go on by myself And he sat down, because he was afraid Then he said, again: You know 97 my flower I am responsible for her And she is so weak! She is so naefve! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer There now 97 that is all He still hesitated a little; then he got up He took one step I could not move There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle He remained motionless for an instant He did not cry out He fell as gently as a tree falls There was not even any sound, because of the sand  XXVII And now six years have already gone by I have never yet told this story The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive I was sad, but I told them: I am tired Now my sorrow is comforted a little That is to say 97 not entirely But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak It was not such a heavy body and at night I love to listen to the stars It is like five hundred million little bells But there is one extraordinary thing when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower At one time I say to myself: Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully Then I am happy And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars But at another time I say to myself: At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night And then the little bells are changed to tears Here, then, is a great mystery For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has 97 yes or no? 97 eaten a rose Look up at the sky Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!";

GAP used to be my source for Fall fashion, walking into the store would inspire me and make me want to buy everything! This season everything is just dull and uninspiring. What went wrong? Go back to basics GAP!    Garfield Kat What I love about the Gap's and Banana Republic's logos are that both are classic and simple. Perhaps like the clothes, but it says (to me), that they are the standards for classic styles that can be worn from year to year and aren't fads that are out of style.    Kimberly M Tyson Seriously dislike. It looks like something that doesn't belong with a clothing co.      Kristen Peters Not a fan     Felicitas Hackmann Can you ask the Marketing department if they would change it back to the old one, if 10,000 fans sign for that? #OldLogoThat could easily be tried with a poll on Facebook.

Andrea Stipe I   usually all for change, but the new logo is pretty bad. I won't say its ugly, but just boring. The old logo at least looked stylish and classy which is how you want your brand perceived I would think.      Joseph David Van Alstyne I loved the updated block logo. What I loved even more was the block logo that had Gap in Helvetica Neue that I've seen sewn onto the jackets. I think it's just a terrible idea to turn away from the block design that everyone recognizes and loves!     Jenna Mills New Gap Logo a No-Go :: http://www.jennaonpr.com/?p=210     Lisa Romanowski OConnor My 2 yr old knows the Gap logo.

Martin Tran your new logo sucks! but it's not as bad as the 2012 olympics logo, that's worse :P     Dan Shust Why do you like the new one?     Natasha Topol To me the only gap logo is the original lowercase logo from the original store on Ocean Street in San Francisco that opened in 1969. If you are going for iconic - that is it.    Citlabilly Zurfeer PresLey nooo!! the new logo its very ugly!! DONT CHANGE THE LOGO!!     Julia Raquel Aguirre not being a cheapo or anything, ive always been down to pay full price at a GAP store  but if the store hasnt been doing so well they shouldnt change the logo, they should lower ticket prices. hello! the logo looks cheap, the clothes might as well be inexpensive too.    Laura Tio I don't like the new logo, what in the world were they thinking? Looks more more like an IT system logo instead of clothing! Horrible!!     Candice Agius The logo suits the new typeface.. But be careful it looks like  erican apparal but with a blue box      Vanessa Grannis There's nothing wrong with change! AND then I saw this monstrosity and I feel I must recant!      La Lu Wow! Not an eye-catcher nor classic at all as the original.      Marisol Estudillo DISLIKE!, changes are good, but you also have to stay true to the brand      Dan Shust follow @oldgaplogo and @gaplogo on twitter for a good laugh     R Mikhail Minst dear GAP:why trade something iconic for something generic? this new logo looks like something i'd expect to see sewn into a factory uniform, not to mention the fact that it looks an AWFUL lot like the logo for DePuy Orthopaedics  do you R      Cory Smith If you wanted a new direction, you didn't have to go too far from your old identity - http://imgur.com/YWAfq.png <- That's just an idea, it only took 2 seconds to make.   Baccari Salim yeh !! i personally work as supervisor in gap in dubai and many of custemers have the s e question which is about the definition of gap so if it can be change the n e plz.    Tracy Rickard It looks like a computer company logo-horrible GAP!! I would never wear that logo.    Ciro Galeno No.    Nancy Mai Cagadoc Ugh really? That's the best you can come up with?    Shirley Mazourek I don't like the new logo whatsoever.    Lissa McGrath The new logo looks cheap. Like someone just threw it together as a placeholder logo on a new website they're building. The old one means so much more. If you're going to change it, please make it something classy rather than cheap. You could use a script font and make it look fresh but still classy.    Mercedes Mouton Francis I REALLY DISLIKE THE NEW LOGO!!!    Mike Ortiz Where can I find the new logo?    Zoe L  don't like the new logo ..    Cherie Weldon From one marketer to another total dislike. It lacks the spirit of the Gap Brand.    Katie Bray-Schmitt terrible! hate the small blue square. seems like a poor attempt at keeping some form of brand identity.    Kim Rossiter I Hate the new logo it looks cheap and boring get rid of it fast    Lisa VanderWilp Gallo Is it supposed to mean Gap is thinking outside the box? It looks like anybody could've created it. There is nothing special about the font or the graphic. Your previous logo is an icon. I would think twice before replacing it with something so generic.    Tracy Wood Franklin Please keep the old logo!!! Not a fan of the new one at all  And I   a designer! ;0)    Carri Shriver I buy everything of my son's from gap. Don't change a thing     Yazmina Donnelly Hhhhhmmmmm .. while I don't love the new logo, I don't mind the idea of stepping out of the box and embracing the curves. Comparing the two logos u can recognize the change in the clothing, which I love. Just don't change anything else!    Sarah Mattix Spillman Don't like it. Some things don't need change.    Ahmad Tawakol There you go, doesn't this look more like Gap? :)http://blog.ahmadtawakol.com/post/1259670102/gap-logo     Ian Glasson As an employee of 10 years do not change it we are iconic and so is the logo  :(   Kim Stoffel Schachtele The new logo SUCKS, I certainly will not dress in their logoed anymore, or my kids either :o(    Melanie Fant Maserati not a fan *DISLIKE* why change something so classic that has been the backbone of the simplicity of their style???    Jennie Jones Hate new logo, looks like software, not clothing. And the old one is so recognizable, its really a bad move.    Kelly Hydock Cavallo one would think you would learn from others like verizon and lucent that a gradient in your logo is a mess'85 doesn't screen print, embroider? lighting? vinyl signage? unless you are traditionally printing the screen a bear to manage while ma    Nadia Zwierzchowska Charette Did I miss something? Where can I see this new logo?    Robert Rodriguez PLEASE DONT CHANGE!!! if it aint broke .    Wanda Ivelisse Negr'f3n L'f3pez It's not just about the logo. It involves the emotional association that loyal customers feel about the face of their favorite store. If you could prove to me that Gap is not as popular with new generations as it was with my generation (in the 90's), I could understand the reasoning. But the fact of the matter is that the true Gap generation has grown with the store, the product & the logo are the adults who now have the buying power. Who does this new logo appeal to?   Linsay Duty New logo at gap.com    Monarose Faul Dear GAP,You may be interested in knowing that the favicon for your website is still of the old logo.Hopefully, this is a sign of an internal dispute regarding your new logo redesign.    Rachael Anthoney Don't change. I love the old logo and it needs to stay that way. It's the nostalgic feeling of GAP and I know everyone finds comfort in the f iliar. Stay the way you are!    Felix Cruz DISLIKE!!!!!!! I've been working for the company for 9 yrs and the original logo as others mentioned is iconic!! A beacon  ong other retailers! The new logo doesn't have any kind of special quality to it AT ALL!!! Very un-original.   Maggie Harney No the new logo looks too much like a computer software progr . It's awful. It needs to be more chic since the prices keep going up. Think Chanel not Microsoft.    Leticia Hunnicutt-Mueller Nooooooo! I veto that crap right back!! Who thought of that BS! They need to be fired !!    Tracy Kinsey Gunn no likey new logo :(!!!!!!!    Shelley Kandola Helvetica is an overused font in logos, and the blue box offset is severely unbalanced. Why change an already fantastic logo?     Aliceson Smith This new logo (which can be googled, our   of the web age) is such a disappointment to a graphic designer like myself. A small change could have been good for you. But like other corporations, you think changing your logo will fix prob   Kelly Lynn Sexton The new logo is terrible. Childlike and plain! I LOVE THE OLD LOGO. It is who GAP is! Coming from a seasoned designer and a huge GAP fan, PLEASE DON'T USE THE NEW ONE!    Oralia Rabadan Where's the UNLIKE button on this thing??? Keep the GAP logo!!! This new one is no good!     Mike Dang Passionate debate? Who's arguing that the new logo doesn't look like it was someone's first Photoshop experiment?   Kelly Lynn Sexton WOW I can't beleive it is on the website already!! It looks SOOOO BAD! I want to cry! A gradient box really???? Wonder how much it cost. I would have charged less and created something much better!     Glen DaSilva is AKQA responsible for this? terrible.    Jizelle Barsalou New logo sucks!!!!!!!!    Kate Robinson I get it, they are stepping out of the box but I hate the way it looks. It looks childish and cheesy. The original is better, it's an icon!   Maranda Seger Keep what you have. The new one doesn't compare!!     Laura Kirby Lawrence I would say the new Gap logo is a big NOGO for me    Nicole Gibney DISLIKE the new logo!     anda Burkett Don't like the new logo booo!     Jitendra Singh Rathore change just for the sake of changing, i dont find it cool i also like the old one nothing special in new one. It seems like GAP word is trying to pull out from 'blue' brand image. See there could be experimental use of khaki color whic    Tommy Nixon Payne I LOVE the new logo!!! It's modern and truly represents a commitment to change. I see a lot of opposing comments, but are we really thinking past the new graphic and digesting what is signifies? This is a company's commitment to change and stay relevant in an environment that is ever changing. Let's embrace it get into the store and see what's happening!!! As an employee of this great company, I   proud to see such a bold move, Kudos      Laura Willi s The only thing worse than the new logo is crowd sourcing for a another new one. If you work with a branding agency you respect, listen to their findings and strategy, do not allow every single member of your marketing te  to put their 2 ce   Erin Johnson Wingard It's horrible! That floating blue box has to go.    Jitendra Singh Rathore If I have to choose I would go for different use of color pattern for Logo like using Gap Khaki, Gap Pink for woman, Gap Dk Grey and else    Nina Kall  When I see the (old) logo, it makes me want to shop! The new logo looks nice too but it doesn't make me relate to the store I love to shop at.   Stefanie Bell The original logo works and sells a style of clothing-- will the clothing style change along with the logo--- what are we in for?? Cheap?? The new logo says just that-- looks like a knock off-- like something sold at walmart! Please just keep it classic and the s e! If it ain't broke--- don't fix it!!   Alvin Martinez So you reveal a crappy logo, then after seeing the negative reaction, you decide to do the stupid thing of asking   to submit their own logo ideas, of which you will probably not pay the actual cost for a logo design for a global brand like you claim to be.  ateur hour for such a huge corporation. What a load of BS!!!!   Clare O Brien Its ugly but it sure has everyone talking about GAP. Nice marketing ploy guys!     Sarah Willi s Sorry guys. It's bad. Wasn't anything kernes from new coke? What brilliant marketing bozo will become a case study after this?     Ellen Makofsky Calderazzo Best! has been those plastic, drawstring bags!!    Kelly Ad s based on the numbered logos on the below blog link, i think it would be a better decision to go with ANY of these instead of the direction you are headed. my faves are: 33, 41, 57, 58, 61, 90, 136 and 137.http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/06/ga   Daria Georgiyeva-Schneider Nope, I do not buy it. Why change it so something cheap and childish? There is nothing wrong with the old logo. Please, do not change!    Sarah Willi s It looks like that  erican Express card that didn't work    Sawyer J. Vanden Heuvel you need to keep something classy (as the gap is) the new logo is refreshing and clean, but the gradient box makes it look cheap. it looks like a 7th grader made it in microsoft word.   Pei Huang old one looks better    Jade Wang I think the point is not about changing the logo or not, the point is '93that so-called new logo is really ugly'94. My idea is that you should gather some logos then ask votes to get a better/best one!     Michelle O'Reilly Collins WHY?    Rachel Wild McCarthy Bring back the embroidered kids' jeans. That's all.    Ann Bergsagel McPherson I   scared of change .oh .I hope it is good. Man!    Sarah Margeurite Dawson i think the old classic gap logo, the one that's still in your fb photo, will always be the way i imagine gap. the new one is.. it's kind of messy, nothing like the simple white on navy lettering. i'll miss it.     Janice Cox Why change?? It is an  erican icon    Julie Malone The new logo is so disgusting. Not to mention, it makes the brand seem about a year behind on trends (re: overuse of Helvetica) which is totally contradictory to what the clothing projects. Why not stick to a classic, but modern logo to reflect the classic, but modern look?    Edwin Tofslie No faster way to alienate the design community, produce a bad taste in the mouth over a already stale brand. Good job!   Grace Bay Don't change it! It's a classic!    Ann Bergsagel McPherson NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO!    JM Knaggs Please go back to the buyers you had about 6 years ago. They were fantastic. I was a regular GAP shopper and was always thrilled with my purchases. Now I scan the store and don't see anything of interest.     Jessica 'Walker' Kelly It's really not a good idea. There is nothing that stands out about the new design. It's boring and not special. These are qualities GAP (I would assume) would not want to be associated with.    Andy Askren A logo redesign w questionable, average-at-best design and blas'e9 attitude to go w it mean Gap and its sister stores won't get any more of my money. Even basics can be had elsewhere from more interesting, engaging places. [ G Y P ]    Lanie Mcbane Interesting .    Erin Chillari Guymon Ugh! HATE IT! Love the classic-ness of the old logo And, I've spent enough money in your stores to feel I should have a say! :)    Laura Hoppe Sal e Don't fix things that arent broken, i didn't hear anyone complaining about the old logo    Andrea Brue Kendall This has got to be a joke.    Eric Chu Is this a big marketing ploy to create some buZ? The logo is so obviously generic. Hmmm    Danielle Marvin It is pretty bad . . .:(    Steffani Jensen Waggoner BIG FAIL!!!!  .sad    Naem Baksh I don't think you should change such an iconic logo but at the s e time I'm curious as to what would The Gap do if they found a logo from crowdsourcing that they liked better?    Zoraida A. Cabrera Who THOUGHT of Changing the LOGO in the 1st place. The original logo is what   assimilate with GAP it IS GAP! This new idea is soooo Not the direction GAP should go. I don't see why in times when   want a f iliar place/trend/commodity such as an iconic logo of a favored clothing store the company thinks of changing that which is the face of the brand?????    Shelbie Henderson Cano Really, hope u didnt pay a big price for that design. Please don't change it!    Jennifer Fortsch-Wright KEEP OLD LOGO    Lanie Mcbane I agree with all of the 160+ comments. It does nothing for me the old logo popped and it stood out from the rest. The new logo is just whatevers:( please Fisher f ily and share holders take in consideration what all your loyal shoppers    John Shepard Funny, we figured you crowd sourced the last abortion you brought to market. Not exactly the most positive PR move I've ever seen. Moving to crowdsourcing at this point is no different than switching to sweatshop labor when there is a backlash against the quality of your manufacturing. You're only digging a deeper hole for yourself. I'd call for a boycott from the design community, but I'm pretty sure most of us have more than enough fashion sense to already be avoiding your lineup of generic over priced apparel.   Mark A. Nead I don't believe for one second that this was originally intended as a crowd sourcing project. You're a smart company, and know d n well this approach you've taken is not how you go about it. Why not be transparent, admit your colossal error in judgment, and roll out plan B. Take a tip from Tropicana.   Dawna Austin Seriously? A new logo? Why would you want to change something that hasn't been an issue? Being just like the Jones-es isn't always the best move for a person, let alone a successful company. Just like sitting by a fire on a rainy aftern    Kendra Ann Simmons Don't start changing things like your logo   That is brand identification  . Circuit city started doing dumb things and now they don't exist so please get smart   changing the logo that   have grown up with is not how you get customers to shop! Customer loyalty is where you need to focus.     Andrew Magill I frequently used your 'old' logo as an ex ple of good logo design. It's iconic, timeless and attractive! The new one is forgettable, cheap and bland. I get it, your sales are 'meh' and you want to reposition the brand. It's depressing to see such a great company disfigure itself.    Katrina Jones Don't like it - it stands for nothing and means nothing. As logos go, its unimaginative. Much prefer the old one.    Ashley Alvarado I don't see a new logo! Where is it?    Jacquelyn Candelas Genius Marketing strategy, I've heard about you guys all day. There is a reason why Mark wore a GAP sweatshirt in The Social Network. hint, hint.    Melissa Marzorati-Bergmann NEVER CHANGE A CLASSIC!!!! - Chanel, Gucci, Gap - It is always a staple in our closet - DON'T CHANGE WHAT IS GOOD!!!    Jessica Martinez Sorry, but the new logo is not good. The old logo was iconic  erican. It IS the GAP. The new logo looks like it just doesn't fit.  erican Apparel is Helvetica,  erican Airlines is Helvetica  so why make GAP the s e? Helvetica is tired design, it looks like somebody just didn't want to take the time. Also, the blue gradient square is terrible -- the gradient makes it look very '90s, in a bad way. You've lost the classic iconic feel that IS the GAP.    Mike Hosier Gap did exactly as they intended, create some noise. Looking forward to critiquing the real new logo, if their is to be one.    Alex Hempton I don't like the new logo either     Jenny Suniga I always thought of the Gap as timeless and classic. The old logo represented that. I can't understand why you would change that!!! I don't even feel like looking at the products now. This new logo is so generic looking!!    Psalm Alfafara Dear Gap,Keep your old logo - it looks timeless and classic, much like what you want your clothes to be. But if you must use Helvetica and an uppercase first letter like your other brands, please feel free to use my design: http://is.gd/fOZ    Marta L. Miloscia  IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT! In your case, don't change it! Why? It's the least of your problems, and just from the comments posted here, the one thing the vast majority of your fans love. BIG MISTAKE GAP please don't change it!    Nicola Westwood No no no. Current logo is iconic. Silly decision.     Garrick Stolz I'll share my design as soon as you send me a retainer. I won't open my sketch pad for spec work or contestsOr maybe you wanna send me a couple thousand bucks of clothes, and I'll wear them for a while, and pay you for the ones I like? How'    Chad Sanderson Send in your designs? Are you serious GAP? This is smelling like spec-work to me.   Vanessa Cordo Love the GAP hate the logo. I think the majority of designers, including myself, agree it looks  ateur. Sorry. Please change your minds and go back to the old one. And ask for your $ back, maybe you should have done the contest and all the designers on here could have given you some better options.     Francis Kelly Thach they definitely need a new logo! lol, it reminds me of a big box of walmart. the new logo was definitely worst though!they need something ''classy''. take banana republic's classy logo.. of the backwards B and R. and The classy logo of Mart    Chad Sanderson  @Vanessa: NO. A contest for a brand of this size is insane. They need to HIRE legitimate designers to get their work done. No one should support spec-work of this level.   Lauryl Murray Oh please don't change it!     Tim Kviz You should be ash ed of yourself, this is a slap in the face to the entire design community. Do the right thing and employ a branding agency to do good work for you.   John Shepard I changed my mind, let the boycott begin. Posting this on AIGA board as well as all over twitter. To any other angry designers out there that posted in this thread, don't forget to unlike the page after your post. We don't want them to mistakenly think that this exploitation is somehow going to benefit their brand.   Emily Farmer Thus is yet another dumb move. Years ago they varied from their classic look and almost lost the company because their sales plummeted. Now, they have a very recognizable brand and logo that is working and they're going to change it to gap with a weird blue box in the corner. It is bland, boring, and does not catch the eye. This is yet another bad move; combined I have found myself drifting away from the company. They are not who I have always loved.     Kimberley Quinn Karas Hey Gap! Like my Mom used to say  If it isn't broken, do not fix it. Classic is good. Nix the blue square!   Ad  Smith If you need to have your logo re-designed (read: the n e of your company typed out in Helvetica), I can do it for at least *half* of the rate you are paying whatever agency convinced you this was still a viable typeface option. I can draw up a contract tomorrow morning.    Sean Farrell Spec work? Seriously?   Cathy Thornes where's the new logo? how do i see it?    Ad  Smith Also, designers: please resist the urge to go I CAN DO IT BETTER! and send in concepts, because I can guarantee absolutely zero of the entries will actually be picked. Instead, the ones the marketing department cherrypicks will be sent to Crispin Porter (or whoever Gap is using currently), to be 'revised' into the final logo. Don't be a sucker.    Tim Kviz PLEASE reject this project, do NOT give GAP your work for free!     Psalm Alfafara o hai. i R deSigneRzz. here iz ur new logo. http://is.gd/fP1EI   Liz Diskin Hux The Gap logo is one aspect to the visual, memorable part of your  azing brand! I'm all for change when something is improved upon but to me, the Gap is perfection. You can't make your product any better!!! Changing your logo makes me a l    Jaci Young Scully Not a big fan of the new logo. The Gap logo is like the Coca Cola logo; A symbol you remember.    Andrea Woda I love the old one don't change it!!!     Ashley Allen Why fix what isn't broken? The classic Gap logo is perfect for the brand.    ber L Trainor I think the new logo stands for GAP thinking outside the box! I still like the original one better though     Dena Marshall Brewster I don't like the new logo    Michael Wah Simply put  No change necessary.     Jose Tejada Why are you considering this as an option? Is there something out in the market that is telling you to do this? Go a bit deeper and back it up with numbers and facts. Do focus groups to your target customers and see what they think of the brand in general. Also do surveys and one-on-one interviews to complement the insights. You will not necessarily see a rise in sales if you do a logo change.    Teresa Gomez Everyone out there please vote for my baby Ally for the gapcastingcalling.com    April Wesson Driggers Why change what isn't broken? Its a timeless design. Save your advertising dollars!     Tracey Ellis Is this the New COKE bait and switch?     Andrew Owen Dear Gap, please don't dig yourself further into a hole. Have some integrity and admit this new logo was a mistake. You're not going to fool anyone by suddenly turning this into 'Crowd Sourced' project. If you really want to listen to your fans, listen to the overwhelming majority saying keep the old logo.   Steve Allcock I'm a brand identity designer, this really is a terrible solution all-round, it's ill-conceived and  ateurish at best. A strategic disaster, I sure hope GAP understand the brand equity they have is valuable and very much concentrated in th   Shingo Ohno I think you are so smart!    Angie Lund Leiker OLD LOGO ROCKS!   Bridget Houdek If it is not broken don't change it. A success for 20 years   Susanne Bart Bitte das alte Logo behalten !!!!!!     Diana Muguerza Lopez I vote for keeping the old one. Are you even reading our comments GAP?     Kristina Walton I'm all about embracing change but the gradient   in 2010? Thumps down.    Leo J. Surprenant WHY CHANGE THE LOGO? IT SOUNDS LIKE A PUBLIC RELATIONS STUNT!    Bridget Houdek I don't think they r    Brie Terry The old logo was fine but the twitter feed about the logo having feelings was enough to piss me off so change it or don't change it who cares, you won't see a cent of my money ever again .     Lisa Wong DON'T CHANGE THE LOGO!! DON'T CHANGE THE LOGO! It's a classic!    Kady Dennell JUST ANOTHER LOGO THAT USES HELVETICA. SIIIGH.     Clare Erickson when you already have such a great brand why are you trying to reinvent logo that already has branded such loyal customers?     Andrey Yanovski Please, bring old logo back!    Bridget Houdek If u read the posts from customers that r true u might loss more than u think u can gain. If u need a rep look at ur fans which might soon be ex fans. Just saying if u r listening      Alissa Thiele Sorry to say but the new logo is terrible. It looks like a person with no graphic design education whipped it up in Microsoft Word. The gradient box makes the logo very outdated and has poor placement. I vote for a new new redesign.   Ashley Allen Alissa you hit the nail on the head!     Jen O'Neal Batmanian oh, the tragedy. the new logo is awful. try again. no, really. please try again.     Joshua Pekera I think asking for spec work is what got you in this mess to begin with. I have an original idea why don't you seek out a notable design agency and pay them to create a new logo that is simple, memorable, timeless, versatile, and appropr     Michael McNally If it's not broken, why fix it? Clean up your lines, not your logo.   Farazana Essa-Malek I love the GAP logo very iconic!!rather not change it    Paz John Don't change it whatever u do!    Regina Molloy omg, that is terrible. if its not broken dont fix it. i love the gap logo as it is. its a classic, known all over the world   Kevin Buth It's easy to start a design firestorm by purposefully sharing bad design with the masses. It's also easy to call blindly into the public ether for new and free designs. What's hard is staying true to your heart and your soul while evolving to the present day. Gap you are a sad ex ple of design, you are mean for manipulating the design community and you will be worse off having ran this fleeting experiment.   Bernadette Jiwa Just curious Gap was the new logo re-design a teaser to introduce a crowd sourced logo competition and social media marketing c paign? Phew!http://www.etchd.com/new-gap-logo-botched-design-or-clever-social-media-marketing-experiment/     Duncan Lucas Joined this group just so I could say how much I loathe, no, hate with a vengeance born of despair the new logo, and, as a (former) professional designer, believe me, I used to love the opportunity to work on rebranding a major corporate bu   Joe Willi s I work at gap and and will NOT wear a badge with that on!   Florencio De Andrade Please don't change it, we all love the old one!! The new one is horrible :(   A er Qudmani please DO NOT change your logo!   A er Qudmani Your logo is one of the most important things that makes me attracted to you, GAP.   David Michael Fong Spec? I stopped doing that sophomore year in design school. And that was mid-80s. BTW, the new logo does suck and I understand you blew you budget with the mistake that it is but asking for freebies?   Sheng Ho Designers of the world: Resist the urge to participate in Gap's crowd sourced project. Don't give them your work for free.   J es Harrison As has been expressed in the previous comments on this post, you're going about this all wrong.A rebranding assignment of this magnitude should never lend itself to a user submitted scenario. It's absurd, it's unethical and worst of all i   Germ'e1n Gabriel Rodr'edguez I agree with Sheng Ho. This is bullshit!!    Mindy Thompson East Why on earth would you change the logo!?! Terrible idea! Change the product but not the logo. That is certainly not Gap's problem. Why would you spend money on a logo that looks like a Xerox logo?   Anka Przy\uc0\u322 uska-Monica DON't change the old logo- it works for u for 20 yrs!! changing one of the most recognizable logo in the world is a horrible idea!   Daniel Francavilla Here's plenty of re-design attempts already;http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/06/gap-redesign-contest/#more-20224   Seraphia Friedman I liked the old logo! Im very nosey about the new one      Alexander Granados the new logo has nothing to do with crowdsourcing    Tim Kviz Remember the you got rid of the whopper? commercials?    Raewyn Tan It looks so uncool it makes me not want to shop there. Who wants to walk out of GAP carrying a bag with that ugly logo. Spoils MY brand.     Micky Du so who's l e idea is this to use this as a strategy to put you on the social media map  WOW groundbreaking man! . or is it that you've realised that the new brand ID actually sucks?.. neither is working for me.    Brianna Orndorff The new logo has no visual impact whatsoever. It's like looking at any other word. I get the throwback to the original logo with the blue square, but the font is just awful for a logo. I've seen better student work.    Germ'e1n Gabriel Rodr'edguez But who did the new logo???    Tim Kviz GAP, please stop listening to   who charge you $ only to tell you to listen to other  , that's only ever a perfect solution when nobody in the room has a good idea.    J es Warfield Where's the 'dislike' button? The new logo is very poor and this strategy of crowd sourcing is a mistake. Maybe it's just a perverse way of getting   to become a Fan on your Facebook page, because this fiasco is the only reason I clicked that button.     Kim Lemieux An icon..no need for change.    Genevra Legg keep the old logo - it's timeless and perfect :o)    Sandra Berlinger The new logo looks cheap. If you go cheap on the logo you might as well reduce them prices to go along with what youre portraying! The old logo looked more high class and thats how   identify with the quality of the clothing. The logo becomes synonymous with the product. So guess what  cheap looking logo= ??? Im sure the quality of clothing isnt any less than before, atleast I hope not, but who wants to go in a store that has a logo like that? Theyre expecting the dollat tree!   Patricia Mc Laughlin Do not change the logo. You've done what you've done for the last few year for a few reasons.    Brandi Lewis keep the logo the s e, dont change it!!!!    Sandra Berlinger Oh, by the way! You should write Andy, 6 years old next to the logo. Itll atleast look like a kiddie contest for re-inventing your logo. LOL     Michael Miller Hate, hate, hate the new logo!! Truly awful!    Semin Ari Ozmorali Where/how can I see the new logo??    Tom Actman Dear Gap,I'll start by letting you know that I'm one half of the design agency Mat Dolphin, based in London, UK. As an agency we're focused on helping   and companies build better brands.This week you launched (if that's the word, as i   Chris Jones Ha ha ha, all you pro designers screwing about whether or not some company changes their logo and the quality of it. Threatening to never spend a penny/cent in their store again! Over the top doesn't even begin to cover it.

Change d logo    Dravin Nayak U wrote word debate in ur status.whr is opposite,everyone hate dis.no debates    Aimee Maddonna Why are you considering changing the logo when it's obvious that 95% of your LOYAL customers would rather you didn't? If you have some horrible new logo design, I certainly won't be buying any clothing from you that has that logo on it. I spend about $700 per season at Gap (sometimes more). I can easily go someplace that isn't trying to re-invent something that didn't need reinvention.    Pato Alegre que buenooo !!!    Catarina Velez Grilo UNLIKE!!!!!!!    Lara Mendon'e7a The first thing I learned about logo design was: IF YOUR BRAND IS STRONG AND   LIKE YOUR LOGO, DON'T CHANGE.    Charlene Scopac Your new logo makes your brand look cheap and unapealing its just ugly..there's something classic , expensive and of very high quality with your old logo I could just imagin with your shopping bags will look like like your walking out of kmart .do you want that lol. oh well off to enter my daughter in your casting call :)    Jennifer Z miello Fusfeld Keep the old logo, please!    Chuck Spidell Here's the new Gap logo: http://drbl.in/63071    Travis Willi s What you're proposing is essentially spec logo work which is unethical and I'm  azed a company who claims to care about design would entertain the idea.     Charlene Scopac Just looked at. http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/06/gap-redesign-contest/#more-20224 some of them are not so bad ..if ur gonna change it you could of done better the THAT    Charlene Scopac Just looked at. http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/06/gap-redesign-contest/#more-20224 some of them are not so bad ..if ur gonna change it you could of done better the THAT    Charlene Scopac Should let your customers vote    Charlene Scopac  @chuck ..please tell me that's a joke..what is that a todem pole? Lol    Sue Batson FAIL     Shahadat Jony before week me buy you new collection t-shirt it's really owsome..and we like ur brand and logo     Andrea Senderoff i think this is brillant.    Paul Biedermann A really disgusting PR ploy, Gap. First an awful new '93logo'94, then a crowdsourcing stunt that just cheapens everything. Disgusting '97 and you're losing a lot of respect. Now you can watch your social media presence suffer the consequences of another form of crowdsourcing (just ask AT&T about their recent experience!). Good luck with that!   John Lander Check my skillz http://dribbble.com/shots/63079-Gap-Logo    Andrea Senderoff I understand   are 'outraged' but in the world of social media these days, contests like 'submit your design!' just don't turn heads anymore. this though - this is turning heads, and will soon turn feet, headed into the doors of gap all across the world to see what they've got up their (short) sleeved (cotton T). Can't wait to see how this unfolds, and despite the neg feedback, im all for this.    Rebecca Hollis My recommendation as someone who works with top brands in Social Media in London UK is to 'hold your hands up, be transparent and say that you might have got it wrong on this occasion. You never know you might actually be able to turn this     Trey Lewis I   so glad you changed the logo--the old one has become stale - this one feels fresh, average, simple--it's a feeling. Restoration Hardware is in the process of rebranding and again good move! Pottery Barn and Abercombie are so stale and boring now. I totally get the direction you are trying to go!    Hakim Griffin this is hakim griffin from Griffin Productions and I do a great deal of logo designing for small and corporate businesses.

GAP lovers: I believe it's the best timing to give GAP an a    Trey Lewis more to come at the Gap:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2BK4Afwq7w    Danielle Hatfield The new logo is atrocious. However the marketing ploy behind this is quite smart. Throw an awful logo out there and get   to talk about you.    Eric J. Gruber New Gap is new Coke.    Anthony Dumville Keep the timeless logo you have used for 20 years. It's perfect.    Ryan Desch ps I'm no designer, but I prefer to be constructive. 1) keep all caps. You want to be 'the' GAP not a 'Gap'. 2) Classic, serif font. The gap offers classic, attractive cloths. 3) There are some great logos on the list, but it wouldn't be horrible in my world to say 'the public wants the old logo' - it could be an opportunity even.    Jose Torres GO BACK TO THE OLD LOGO!!!!!!!! If it's not 'broke' don't fix it     Kimie L. Kennedy i dont know why you love the new logo cause it sucks! whoever thought of that is not a graphic designer, they are lying to you! IT IS AWFUL AND A DISGRACE TO DESIGN!    Gary Alexander I love the idea of change and I   excited to see something new from Gap. Whether it is a logo, the  azing denim in stores, the launch of the Black Pant and the fashion items that are showing up in stores. It's about time GAP steps out of the box. Let go of the past and live in the present.    Denise DiGiacomo McVey Um why don't you have your new logo on your FB page? Just sayin'     Jacqueline Turcotte Keefe The new logo stinks!!! Did you do a marketing study? A company of our size and longevity should have done. If you seriously intend to pursue a logo change, several firms specializing in this area should have been consulted. Don't insult your company and the design industry by throwing whatever up against a wall and seeing what sticks. This is  ature and so is the new logo. Is this a joke?My opinion of your company just went down.    Jaye Weaver Rather than changing your logo (if the purpose is to generate more sales), why not open your market up  We here in Australia cannot buy GAP. We can only get it when we travel overseas .we can look at your online store however you do not ship to Australia :-(. Please consider this!!    Elisha Loewen Good font, but the fading blue square in the corner looks cheesy and cheap.    Caitlin Hull it's just a logo. calm down.    Kristin Kropp There is so much brand equity already invested in the old logo--the GAP logo is a recognized symbol for classic quality products--from the logo to the signature navy shopping bags! I understand that there have been some changes in the cuts     Jennifer Takacs O'Shea Businesses strive for years to identify & become Iconic DO NOT CHANGE IT!!    S antha Hall Create your own logo: like this one! Give Gap a true Spec contest: http://tinyurl.com/36ts3wc    Isabelinda Schieferle I agree dont' change the logo. Keep it. The logo dose not look out dated . You have to think: Would Nike change thier logo?  I think NOT.    Erica Gleiner Your request for designers to continue to produce ideas, with absolutely no promise of choosing a winner and providing compensation, reduces this to spec work. AIGA, the professional association for design, stimulates thinking about design   Ad  King I've just seriously laughed my ass off at that new GAP Logo, that makes the GAY GAP Brand even gayer, That my son is what you call a WORD ART LOGO of pure FAIL.    Missy Kelley Asking for redesigns from your community is a low move. You've got the money to pay for work. Spec work is for assholes Gap. get it together.   Yen Ming Logo is horrible but the motive is awesome.    Andrea Senderoff this is great. missy kelley - i dont think its a low move - look at all of the voices and feedback gap is hearing - money aside, there are talented   out there that can come up ideas, maybe better then the top agencies - and now through social media, GAP is able to hear and see them. I think this can appear to be a low move, but really - its just the opposite. then again, who knows - guess we will see..    Subi Wilks New logo? Noooooooo!    Jessica Pickard http://www.gapcastingcall.com/GapCastingCall/EntryDetail.html?id=199531 please vote for my baby     Victor Stuber the new logo is awful. just please keep the old one    Jen Showalter A multimillion dollar corporation is asking designers for SPEC ideas? Sh e on you - that is completely unethical and wrong. You should be embarrassed. Hire someone competent and pay for it. Apparently it's  ateur hour over there. I   sad   Andrew Fraser Stewart Wow. I hope your community manager is showing all these comments from YOUR CUSTOMERS AND FANS to your CEO's and Marketing Managers.   Jessica Pickard http://www.gapcastingcall.com/GapCastingCall/EntryDetail.html?id=199531 vote for this little angel    Tarra Del Chiaro I hope that this new logo wasn't paid for.    Felix Sanchez What a shitty, shitty thing to do. You want a new logo? Quit asking for free designs (and I pity the designers who fell for this and sent serious submissions) and hire a professional designer/firm to create one for you. Your crowdsourcing ploy is nothing short of SPEC work, and completely disregards the contributions that designers have to business and culture contributions that have a value! You want a new logo, here you go: http://bit.ly/b8KqBY   Aditya Brahma Yoga Is this a joke? I'm a GAP minded and I wouldn't buy GAP products anymore if you stay with this new Logo.    Greg Odom What's up with GAP asking designers to SPEC? Crowdsourcing is the worst thing for the design industry. I can't believe a national brand is cheap enough to not go through the proper design process and dumb enough to think my little sisters idea for their re-branding is the right choice. It demeans all of us: our professionalism, each other, and our industry.   Charlie Triplett Here's what I think of the new logo and spec work too: http://yfrog.com/6ba7hfj     Aaron Pou Okay, so I had to click the 'LIKE' button to post a comment, very clever.So I think Laird+Partners and execs at The Gap are pulling one of the most clever heists on the general public. This is a great way to get   talking about your br   Chris Kemp  Bad taste creates many more millionaires than good taste.Do you ask your doctor for free treatment so you can decide if he's good enough? Does your landlord let you rent for free to see if you might stay? Do you work for free to see if   Laura Duquette So now one of the largest retailers in the nation is fishing for spec work? This has to be a joke. http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work   David Wolf I'd be happy to create a logo for GAP; but not for free. Unless.. Tell ya what.. If I can take your clothes home (for free) and wear them around town for a few weeks to show them off, and get opinions, then return the ones that I don't like (probably all of it) . Naw, that'd be stupid.   Alexander Marse WHAT A FAILURE IN DESIGN. If you're doing this in house, hire an agency. If you're with an agency, find a new one.    Leo Bauza It's so awesome! Just one suggestion make it in Papyrus font and kern the P really far away from the A and the G really close to the A (this will make it edgy) and get rid of the square, just make it 3D (You should call J es C eron)   Hasan Tahsin OMG FUCK HELVETICA! You new logo is just ugly. Are you really retarded to understand what ugly is it?    Dave Moore this crowd sourcing project seems a little staged to me, (No.1) Release poor brand (but don't actually apply it to any of your marketing material, please see top of page), (No.2) Wait for a reaction (No.3) set up a twitter account as the      Chase Mitchell Here's my submission. It's a minimalist approach. http://tinyurl.com/32rh68z    Andrea Senderoff this is getting wild - GAP, can you speak up?    Karla VanBibber Porter I agree with several here. Besides the obvious fact that it is a crappy design, as someone else pointed out, there was no Press Release, no change to the signage. This is either a PR stunt or a craptastic way to glean ideas (read: CHEAP) fr   Christian Layolle Why not something more like this ? http://bit.ly/gaplogodenim    Joe Maguire This is essentially asking for free labor. Your brand is worth billions, and you' are asking for work on speculation. Do you open your store and give out free clothes? No. So why would you ask for free labor from   who buy your clothes   Charlie Roberts There ARE pretty good ones here -- http://blog.iso50.com/2010/10/06/gap-redesign-contest/#more-20224And now I   starting to think it was a bad logo on purpose  that's a lot of comments in 15 hours.    Libby Pfonner I work in the marketing department for my company, and I think that in this economy changing your logo is one of the worst changes a strong company can make. You will not be as recognizable and instead of standing out, as you might be hoping for, it will actually have the adverse effect . Stay true to your brand and develop upon what you do best!   Danny Cooper Sounds fun - http://i.imgur.com/8AncF.png    Joshua A Laney SPEC work is unethical. Crowd-sourcing is spec work. Please read this article about the AIGA's position on speculative work.http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work   Joshua A Laney And then hire a firm to design your identity. Why? Because IT'S YOUR IDENTITY.   Andrea Senderoff there is no way the gaplogo twitter account is really GAP. I know this stunt is crazy, but the word choices coming out of that twitter is not something a brand like GAP would do. Has GAP made any comment yet? I still feel like they are doing a wild social networking c paign and they are going to launch a (paid) contest, now that they have everyone's attention. Atleast I hope something like that is their plan.    Krista Kriesick Peck Sorry Gap, hate the new logo. Your old lettering and color scheme is much more eye catching. The new lettering/oddly placed square looks elementary and awkward. I can't see buying things with this logo on it. Please bring back the old logo.    Chaucee Stillman Please keep the old logo. I'm honestly no afraid of change, I just think the new one sucks. Maybe if you made a BETTER looking new logo then it would be okay. But the current new logo is awful.    Krisna MacDonald whoever designed this new logo deserves to be tarred and feathered. yesterday.    Edward Ball fail.    Tony Pinto As a designer and a member of the AIGA, the national association of design, what your asking for is against the professional standards of designers; crowdsourcing is SPEC and reputable designers do NOT do spec work. If you ask for spec, yo   Siwan Owen New logo looks cheap! Keep your current logo - it has a great, classic look!!    Krista Kriesick Peck I'm thinking it's a Piperlime-ish type of move, along the lines of their mean girl c paign. Shock value & that logo is a joke & will tie into the crowdsourcing. Who is ok'ing all this? Very bizarre imo.    Bill Bergmann HELVETICA!!! and a box? guess it was a speed round on designing a logo. Ok - You have 2 seconds to make a logo. I also agree with Tony Pinto, i   also a member of AIGA - and will be bringing this up at next weeks GAIN conference.     Greg Washington Gap hacked my website because I designed a better logo and they didn't want the world to see it. It was getting too many retweets. Well Gap, you can't stop the pain, here it is    in all it's glory: http://www.anotherfaceinthecrowd.com/gap/yourbetterlookingsibling.jpg   Bill Bergmann I also thought - why not just go retro and use one of your old logos - http://www.retro-housewife.com/images/fashion/1960/gap-1969.jpg    Phillip Crowe http://craplogo.me/post.php :)    Rolf Nelson First a horrid logo, then attempts at taking advantage of designers that would have done it better. Classy, GAP, classy.     Chris Rosepapa Said perfectly  I can't believe a national brand is cheap enough to not go through the proper design process   It demeans all of us: our professionalism, each other, and our industry.   Ashley Allen It looks like s***.     Bill Bergmann Nice Phillip! Fall into the Crap (http://craplogo.me/post.php)   Zack Ward crowd sourcing? really? that's dumb. keep the old one.     Cat Rocketship This is astonishing. Nowhere is it acceptable to ask for designers to work for you for free, let alone to fix your own mistakes and shitty rebrands.   Ray Embrey One step forward, Two steps back. The Groupon c paign was A+, but this one is an F. And your response to crowdsource other logo designs is obviously unplanned. Otherwise you wouldn't ask fans to wait for more details. The only GAP I see here is between the brand and its customers. Show your unhappiness by unliking GAP!    Mark \f1\b 'bb'd1'ad'ad'd2\b0  Wienands actually . do please crowd source, or better yet keep that new logo, it kinda fits your image and quality of clothing anyways     Yen Ming GAP, you guys are brilliant!! The Buzz, the free PR, the free logo design and opinions from designers all over the world! This c paign is awesome! Kudos!!     Marc Raymond Gap is the new Tropicana. You blew it with that logo.    Tom Creed Maybe you should focus on your clothes. Used to love wearing GAP, a new logo wont bring me back    Matthew E Wengerd Spec? Seriously?    Conrad Panganiban why haven't you changed the logo on this fb page? hmmm     Andrew Davis I'm a photographer, are you going to start 'crowdsourcing' your photography soon too? The new log is a pile of crap-it reminds me of a lowend financial services firm or some other corporate nonsense.I suppose if you take the view that any p     Olivia Knapp PR Stunt. Ugly Marketing ploy. Hey, reminds me of Hollywood Starlets!    Matt Denner Come on, if you're not sure what logo is best, pay someone to create a handful and then the crowd can vote on them. But don't ask talented   to work for free to fix your screw-up.   Jennifer Long My kid drew this!    Christopher Fu Go with a THINNER font Dickhead!    Eric Winters You are going to fix one of the worst logo re-designs in recent history, by getting the public to fix it for you, for Free?!?! Down with spec. Down with GAP!    Christopher Fu Here try this Helvetica Neue 23 or HelveticaNeue-UltraligEXT. I just did. What the hell. Great thing about it is that you can also customize it easily to your fitting. DOH!    Kris Andrews never liked GAP before, like them even less now  now both your logo as well as your cloths can be made from kids for pennies (or in this case not even pennies)    Kelly Whelan-Enns Hahaha way to let the target market do the work for u lol!!    Eric Mai if it isn't broken, don't fix it. the original gap logo is classic and iconic. by changing it.. you've completed destroyed what it took 20+ years to build.     Joe Thompson Keep the old. Update the fit of your clothes.    Francois Swanepoel Bad idea!    Christopher Fu I just killed a spider with anti-freeze. Thank you that felt really good.    Christopher Fu Throw me a frickin' bone      Andrew Davis Did you know you can hire professional designers who won't just make your font with 60 pt. helvetica and call it good?    Liz Prill an Terrible.    Stacy Scarlett Hartshorn all I have to say is: Duuude  wrong way.    Karla VanBibber Porter all it's missing is Comic Sans!!     Scott Sommerfeld http://bit.ly/d2Px1x   Mark Lanford the new logo is just awesome! way to go te  gap!    Niki West Sebastino Here's my idea for a new Gap logo: http://bit.ly/90TK5TAs a loyal Gap customer, and professional graphic designer, I'm proud to offer this hard-working logo. It serves a dual-purpose of re-branding the Gap while illustrating my opinion of s    Jen Showalter What you call crowdsourcing is stealing. Designers and design students, GAP wouldn't give you new clothes for free if yours looked old or stupid. Don't give them a new logo for free either.    Irene E. Martinez Santizo Should make a contest to renew their image, and I'm sure there will be better proposals than currently used, as its brand represents a lifestyle and in 20 years has excelled. This new logo reflects no style at all GAP. Most graphic designers are shocked by this change as unfortunate in his image.    Mark Lanford dear gap - just so you know i found out that my computer comes with like a hundere million fonts! yiou could try making your logo using a different font for every letter! .that would be cool     Josh Crain Sh eful. Crowd sourcing? Really? You might want to read what AIGA (the oldest and largest professional membership organization for design) has to say about SPEC work: http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work    Andrew Read Bring back the old logo!    Joktan Rogel Nowhere in the post did the Gap admin say that the company was seeking a logo for free. The post simply said that details were coming in the next few days. So all of you bitching, complaining and posting unnecessarily negative bullshit need    Iain Connor Trying to save yourself from this terrible decision by asking us all to do spec work? Terrible.     Andrew Davis Joktan-the problem isn't that they are asking for feedback, it's that they are asking for designs. Read the AIGA article linked above, and you will see why this approach is such a bad idea.     Laura Holder The only thing that could make the new logo worse is if you had used Comic Sans or Papyrus.   Sofi Quevedo Fail!!    Sheriff Woody I've improved your logo, how do I submit it?    Kurt Krause I think there is a gap in their logo     Ad  King I LOL'd Retards removed my comment, grow the fk up!    Brian Kroeker Worst attempt at salvaging a poor decision ever. Next time you let PR/'social media' retards fuck with your brand, make sure that they're not devaluing an entire profession while they do it.    Danny Chung SPIN SPIN SPIN. Design by committee = death to creativity.     Gary Bedell Gap - some advice: Reset. Reboot. Don't try to mask this major design fail with a crowd-sourcing play. Hire some professionals to define your new brand. You are embarrassing yourself and demeaning design professionals.   Joktan Rogel  @Andrew I understand where you are coming from, but there is a better way to influence a brand than being vitriolic and hateful. This whole thread reeks of negativity. It's unfortunate that the   who are most negative are drowning out those who are trying to be reasonable and explain why the GAP made a mistake with its approach.     Mario Sacc ango Call Beloved Advertising in Orlando. In the meantime, I'll stop shopping at GAP for my clothes.    Rhony Bhopla The original logo was better. I think you wasted a lot of dollars on this new logo.     Jen Showalter Joktan, seriously?    Kate Stein The new logo stinks. Honestly it makes me not want to shop there.    Kate Stein It reminds me of something a consulting firm would use. l e.     Joktan Rogel  @Jen: I know, it hurts to be called out for hyperbole, doesn't it? The GAP hasn't taken anyone's designs for free. Conditions haven't been announced, and you're accusing a brand of stealing. It's premature and immature.    Wagner Dos Santos This debate is incredible. I can't imagine that it went in the intended direction after crowd sourcing your new logo and branding. Like Mario said, check out http://www.belovedadvertising.com/ instead of using your current approach because as it's said, you get what you pay for.    Alison Sl on http://www.no-spec.com/   Irina Levinsky why fix what's not broken??? hate the new logo     Ciao Mylove BUMMER  the blue box original logo is a CLASSIC !!!Some classics you just don't mess around with.While mildly attractive, the new logo is bland and boring compared to the ORIGINAL AND CLASSIC GAP LOGO in the blue square!!!It just lac    Irina Levinsky Mickey Drexler would've never let this happen. How could you let him go???    Jeremy McCormick Step 1: 'design a bad logo'Step 2: 'silently' release itStep 3: wait for public outcry and   to spread your brand by word of mouth, drawing attention to your facebook, website and so on. Job done.   Dave Moore Dear Gap, Please let me know why you felt you had to remove my last comment? I did'nt use any foul language, was it because I   on to your little Branding / crowd sourcing sc  ?   Vanessa Donley I can't believe your PR te . Crowdsourcing? Seriously? No really? How much deeper are you going to dig your hole? Can we start crowdsourcing your fashion designs too? I'm sure your employees would LOVE THAT!   Alyssa Joy Wicks The new logo is just awful! Change it back!    Bill Bergmann In case you did not see this - Advertising Age did a good write up: Gap Speaks Out: Yes, the Logo Is Real http://adage.com/article?article_id=146353    Bill Bergmann Also - here is the company that created the logo: http://www.lairdandpartners.com/    McKane Davis I have a hard time believing that the new logo is real. It's really horrible. If it's not real and this is a PR stunt, it's backfiring quickly.    Jen Showalter  @Joktan, so it's not stealing to ask for spec work unless they refuse to pay for it. Funny, that's not what I learned in school. Does Gap really need a defender, honestly? They are guilty of doing something really stupid. Why can't I say s   Jen Showalter PS - they *are* stealing. They should be paying for the ideas they are asking for. They are a multimillion dollar company. What they asked in this post is not ethical. Ideas are just as valuable as execution. Sorry if you disagree.   Alan Hildebrandt wow tho logo is absolutely horrible you really messed up on this one gap    Philip Engel http://www.craplogo.me/    Mark Lanford art directors everywhere are jumping out of buildings   Jay Moni Robinson Do any of you actually know what the original logo was? How about the original coke bottle? Do the research, pay attention . 'GAP' is coming out of the box, evolving but Gap will ALWAYS be THE iconic blue box!! If you dont know now you know!! Keep moving forward Gap!!    Wesley Kelley If anyone really cares about them trying to spin off bad work into crowdsourcing and stealing good designers hard work: unLIKE their FB page. Believe me when they see their numbers dropping they will get the msg.   Alyson Miller Howe I love gap, but I HATE the new logo. The great thing about Gap is that it is timeless and this new logo is not timeless!    Christina Lannen Gap - How about reducing your prices so that you're only charging a $1.00 more per item that you pay the poor laborers in the sweat shops. Whatever you paid for that new logo was way too much!     Diana Savage Keep the old logo.     Bill Barnwell C'mon you guys are getting sucked in. This was all planned by GAP from the beginning. The new logo is just too ridiculous. Look at all the attention they are getting now.    Martin Jensen How about no? http://www.no-spec.com/     Dieter  ick Don't change your logo, its timeless.     Kelcy Chapin Engstrom I NEVER BUYING FUCKING KHAKIS EVER AGAIN    Jay Carlson Dear Gap:I'm doing this little project where I'm trying to rethink my clothing style. so here's what I want you to do:-please design me a custom outfit. jeans, shirts, perhaps a coat and hat since it will be getting cool soon all the bes   Dieter  ick This is what happens when the marketing te  starts calling the shots on design.   Marvin Leo Forte Crowd sourcing (spec work) is your solution? Argh! Spec work is an insult to professional graphic designers. Hire a talented designer and let them do what they do best, and pay them for their work.   Tim Wood I propose http://imgur.com/mE2I3.jpghttp://imgur.com/UfCKt.jpg   Mark Hennessy I propose this logo:http://goo.gl/q5Ov   Danny Gibas So you hired a designer to screw up your image, and now you want us to do spec work for free to fix it. You fail twice.   Joshua J es Paynter LOLi don't see what the problem with the new logo is - it is dry and generic, just like gap clothes!this is all just a media-attention ploy on behalf of the gap to get   to pay attention to them. and guess what, it worked! the probably    Jen Showalter Wow, the new design suggestions are HILARIOUS.    Christine Patronick There is absolutely nothing aesthetically pleasing about this new design. It looks like a boring, nondescript corporate something-or-other. It doesn't reference the old logo and it is in no way fresh and exciting. But gap's clothes aren't r    DW Ferrell Yeah, fail TWICE. Please  , stop devaluing the entire design industry by throwing your work at The Gap for free. (Hey high-schooler  I'm talking to you.)

Steve Cohen You need a new n e as well. How about Chasm or Abyss. Or better yet, Canyon. My work is done here.     Howard Lerman Gap, your new logo feels like a corporate IT consulting firm. BearingPoint, SAIC, etc. Not fresh and fashionable.    Paula Wirth As a designer, I'm no fan of spec work, or having lay  design your logo for you --- maybe you should just reconsider the design te  you went with originally for your new look, and hire someone new? Can we suggest new design te s, instead?   Mabel Peralta fail fail fail    Nicci Marie Miller So . Basically you want to steal the work of a generous designer? Sh e on you GAP, sh e!   Mabel Peralta are you guys high on crack? your new logo sucks monkey turds on a hot day while one of the kids from the jersey shore is fist pumping to michael bolton..IT SUCKS THAT BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UGH im visually scarred    Mabel Peralta i rather see a jersey shore kid fist pump to michael bolton while i stand knee deep in hot monkey turd..than to agree with Gap that they like their new logo NO this was an epic fail beyond EPIC.stop playing with microsoft powerpoint cir     Will Gay Crowd sourcing is SPEC WORK and is not how you elevate design and design thinking at your company. Designers are professionals and should be paid accordingly. Grow a pair and hire a reputable design agency to rebrand yourself AND take the a   Mabel Peralta  @will agreed      Regina Sagana First you guys fuck up. Then you want someone to fix it for free? I'm with Mr. Gay hire an agency and save your image while there's still time. While your at it, fire the art director/intern that designed that horrible logo.   Nate Austin however much you paid.. you paid way too much.. anybody with no talent and mspaint could have made that logo    Odyss'e9e Ndayisaba Way to go    Adrian Roselli If you're a designer reading this, don't fall for it. Gap is asking you to do spec work -- essentially to work for free. Don't minimize your profession by giving away your skills. I'll bet Gap paid far more for this new logo than they will compensate even the winner of a new design. And that agency got paid for prototype designs before turning out the ultimate winning logo.   Jacob H HEY GAP FUCK YOU AND YOUR SPEC WORK!PAY A REAL DESIGNER TO DO A GOOD LOGO FOR YOU NOT JUST A SHITTY ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE STUDENT WORK.Your logo is the most important piece of branding you have, don't whore it out to some untalented kids with   Michael Cragg pretty sad GAP turns to the public for designs for a new logo after fucking it up  don't design for free! http://www.no-spec.com/   DW Ferrell I agree with Regina. In fact you should hire the agency she works for so she can take a shot at it. http://www.facebook.com/visualade?v=app_7146470109#selfish-plug   Elizabeth Gast This is beyond LOW!!! I hope you get boycotted!!! http://no-spec.com/   Ricardo Mu'f1oz so little respect for your customers and your own company   Daniel Kim I'm sorry. I don't know how that is when you guys say we love our version. It really concerns me. The new logo is something a freshman in graphic design would conjure up in 1hr. There's nothing ascetically pleasing or nice about it.Please   Ola Laurin Dear GAP! Please read this:http://weblog.muledesign.com/2010/10/dear_gap_i_have_your_new_logo.php   Alex Scott If I were to pitch.. it would look something along these lines.http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6742/gapu.jpgRetain the classic colour & shape, remove the serif, move to the modern and clean. Do the s e with the collections, less items,    Kimberly O'Neill logo blows    Phil Tretheway a company like GAP crowd sourcing their logo is cheap and disrespectful to the graphic design profession.Mr GAP, please read this:http://weblog.muledesign.com/2010/10/dear_gap_i_have_your_new_logo.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&u   Brian Sulit If Draper were on the account this never would've happened.   Daniel Rodrigues I really was hoping that it was a joke, when I saw the new logo on the website I was greatly disappointed the old logo is a lot better!    Christopher Simmons So.. your solution to a really hideous design is to undermine the entire design profession asking an unlimited number of   to take an uniformed stab at it for free? Tsk. Tsk. Try again.   Diana Santana Rosa  Oh my goodness!! Gap you have the NERVE to ask for spec work?!! I commend you for reacting fast to the negative reaction towards your new and ugh logo, but on the other hand you do suck on the way you're going about correcting it. Geez - Gap, Don't fix what's not broken.

Ya know, the whole If it ain't broke thing? Changing it just to say you changed it when there's no reason to change it means you guys could have great success in the newspaper and magazine industries.   Michael McManus Oh man--these comments crack me up. I could care less about your logo, but I have to hand it to you'85 you did a remarkably, if not shockingly, swell job at screwing up three letters. Much like this logo, I foresee Gap updating their marketing personnel with something better.    Carmen Lucia Godoy Cofi'f1o Keep the old one!!   Alex P. Parisi Hey Gap, take your spec and go to hell! http://www.no-spec.com/   Regina Sagana I like DW's idea of hiringhttp://www.facebook.com/visualade?v=app_7146470109Our intern would have probably made a better logo .if we had one.    Edward E onn Knuff Wow, I guess your company has really gone downhill.Shove it!http://www.no-spec.com/   Justin Patchett Sounds like a deal  Except for the part about payment. Oh, really? None? No. You paid an agency for something you're looking at just throwing down a garbage disposal anyway. If you want my input, pay up. http://www.no-spec.com/   Jeremy Gruszewski I know you might not care about any single individual customer, but as a designer, if you make this into a spec project and implement a logo made through that process I will burn all my GAP clothing and never shop there again. Just saying.    Donna Kiel Understand that you want to freshen the image, but the new logo lacks impact. As a graphic designer I always had problems w/the thick & thin font in the old logo, but the new one is just blah. And meaningless. And trite. And well, you get the idea. The old logo might not have been perfect but it was iconic; the new meh, a throwaway    John Bunka Double FAIL! The Gap needs to rethink more than just their logo! http://www.no-spec.com/     Edward E onn Knuff I suppose, next you'll want a bailout from Ob a!Imagine the acronyms      Hugh Sato TL;DR: the internet is smarter than you, and the hivemind will tear you down.    Matt Hook The new logo looks more like a sticker you'd find on a new computer. It looks less like a clothing label than it does a label for a software progr . Hopefully this isn't the best design your marketing dept c e up with      Christian Caliban Couture the new logo looks very compterish  like something you'll see on a pc    Jesse Bulger hey you sick fucks. a small business could be started with the revenue that SHOULD be generated from a true re-branding for an  erican classic. what the fuck is wrong with you asking for free work?   Scott Belsky GAP Folks: Lets think beyond the crowdsourcing spec contest solutions. It's time for a better way  Some thoughts on the topic: http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2010/id20100122_047502.htm     Sasha Gajic Here's my version for you rebranding. I think it is much better than a new logo which you have chosen.VERSION 1http://99designs.com/designs/5738430-original   Kent Sanchez Gap, unfortunately I don't think that a passionate debate unfold. It is more so of a bashing and utter hate that a company who we believed in, cracked to the modern society's uniform 'Helvetica'     Julie Fournier No one says NO SPEC WORK bettter than no-spec.comAsking   to work for free is WRONG! Sh e on you, Gap! Sh e!   Kim Brubeck Smith FAIL. There is nothing modern nor contemporary about the new logo; it is insipid and completely lacks the character Gap has spent the last 20 years building in the previous branding.   Andrea Guthrie Ferguson The new design does not impress me. I will say that asking for customer input for design ideas likely wasn't an attempt to undermine the profession as many have said, but an attempt at CYA when they realized it had gone horribly wrong really fast. Now that CYA attempt is flailing down the mountain out of control as well.     Barbara Danese showed this new logo to my 8 year old and 10 year old - even they recognized it was l e. What they said was why would they change the logo that everyone recognizes to that l e one? Out of the mouths of babes    Gabriel Castro Aguilera This is the one ;)) http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2024501/GAP.png    Alison Sl on Crowdsourcing, sounds like ..outsourcing looks like THEFT!!!     Tara Hoffmann The new logo looks like a rev ped Facebook logo (including matching the blue box color). On the Gap website, instead of popping out, the logo just blends into the background. The original version was a timeless design that truly represented the classic style of the Gap.     Dave Miranda Wait a minute, let me get this straight: you want MY work for free? Sorry, GAP, my time and creativity actually has value. Just ask any of my clients. I understand that you are trying to save a few bucks but you've made a huge mistake in pu   Vera Holroyd Dear GAP, I'm joining the thumbs-down group. Why fix what's not broken? Just remember the Classic Coke, or more recently, the Tropicana packaging debacle? If you insist you need some kind of transformation, you've got some lovely feedback now  Perhaps make lemonade by launching a new logo casting call (something you are good at!)? Good luck! I   rooting for you!     Dani Christopher WHY?!? the old GAP was classic. Gap with a cube? i admittedly base where i shop on the logo, & i will not shop at Gap with a cube    Barbara Cade I like the old one.    Tricia Hall Do not like. I love the old logo. Don't change something that was going good for you! What a waste of time and money to change a logo that works so well. Offer different things to the customers to draw the business.    Sean Lewis Don'tyou all see what's going on? GAP decides to make a ridiculously NOVICE logo, and suddenly the whole world is talking about it! Its a marketing ploy I bet their website hits have increased 300 or 400%! Now the suffering GAP that has been on the back burner in consumers eyes, has stolen the spot light! Genious! Well done GAP!   Steve Balistreri Are you guys serious? Is this like some kind of dimwitted attempt at a new coke publicity stunt? I'm a designer, and to be honest, I'm not sure if I can forgive this. Not only have you de-valued your brand, but you have also insulted an e   Kayla Wilkins I like the old logo wayy better the older design was clean, classic, iconic, and bec e what a logo was supposed to do: a way for consumers to identify the store's identity. The old logo was gap's icon. This new logo looks completely  ature; the look isn't nearly as bold or iconic as the old one. I don't know why it was redesigned, when the old logo did it's job perfectly: it bec e an icon for gap, and is identifiable by anyone anywhere with this new design, you completely lose that.    Courtney Henley-Anderson Stick to old logo! New one sucked!    Ronnie Joseph sometimes change is good , but in this case the change is bad        Valerie Clark Your old logo is SO MUCH BETTER than this new piece of shit. Fire your creative te ---immediately!    Michele White Not sure if it's been said before but I'm pretty sure that logo was designed in Powerpoint. BTW, asking for spec work after you realized your logo was a disaster. That's l e. Fellow designers or just out of college designers, please DO NOT fall for this. They'll probably steal your work.    Ron Pluth  crowd sourcing my ass. what are you going to do, average together all the different designs you get?no, you're going to steal one of them. sh e on you.    Jacob H Hey, idiots who run GAP, why don't you get a bunch of homeless   to design some clothes for you too?That'll go nicely with a crowdsourced logo.There's a lot of negative comments in your post about how wrong it is to crowdsource your ne    Rayna Cook the new design is awful it does not get a like vote, I wish I could unlike it!!!!    Dave Bour Why did you change your logo, why did you accept this new design, and WHY are you crowd sourcing this now? I think you have officially pissed everyone off now.    Maria Eugenia Sad New logo is totally ugly. Keep the old one please!!    Michelle Cannarozzo Guerra Omg! Is that a logo? Please, for the love of god, do not fix something that's not broken. Love the old logo. Simple. Classic. Now, what you should be focusing on is the clothing line, making it better, more stylish. Look at JCrew. They're classic, have tons of style and are doing very well.     Irish Harvey Here is the perfect logo: http://www.shutterboxphotobooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/gap_logo_profile.jpg    Esther Lu I love Gap, but your new logo looks like it belongs to some nerdy technology company, it does NOT look like the face of classic high fashion.    Glory Quiett Really wish you would change back to the old logo. The old one is classic. Not a thing wrong with it, and instantly recognizable. This new one hurts my eyes. Not only with the odd font, but for some reason that blue square keeps drawing my eyes to the upper right. Very distracting and boring. Gap, what?    Andres Rivera Pesquera dont like it'a1'a1'a1'a1    Paulo Lapuz As a professional graphic designer, this is a bit offensive so you're saying that Joe Blow next door can come up with a logo that addresses the needs and requisites of a brand '97 its image, its demographics, the psychological associations    Chad Brooks This new logo, if you can even call it that is ridiculous. Just change the font to Helvetica and throw a square with a gradient in the corner, this has to be a marketing ploy and if so it's successful. If not you have permanently d aged a established brand.   Chelsea M Jennings I really like the current Gap logo the potentially new one is really terrible. You don't have to be a graphic designer to see how bland it is and the box is just confusing. I really hope you don't go with that one I would never by my daughter's a sweater with that monstrosity on it.     Deborah Prefontaine I do not like it at all.     Anna M Pawelczak Hate your new logo. It reminds me of goodwill. This is so ugly and cheap. Change it back please. I think who designed this had no clue what they were doing. Sorry but true. And I do love Gap.     Alma Angelina Larios-Villa As a loyal GAP consumer, the new logo looks CHEAP to say the least. SORRY but it does     Sarah Leach cheap and ugly! what is wrong with the one you have?! what a waste of money to come up with that!     Sabrina Montez Dislike. Not a fan of the new logo     Richard Mellnick see my wall post    Elisa D'Alessandro You can be my agency's client and we'll probably charge you a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of what you spent on this piece of crap. Helvetica with a square filled with an ugly colored gradient that makes the word hard to see? REALLY?!   Angelina Pusateri Brown Some things shouldn't change. Your Logo as is looks upscale and is widely recognizable. The new logo looks like it was made in Microsoft Paint and appears generic and cheap.     Abby Norcross Welytok That logo is heinous. Wow. Truly and terribly ugly.     Duncan Pitchford Looks like it was created by an 10 year old with a 10 year old version of MS Word. Why do corporate chieftans feel the need to ruin iconic brand logos? Do you really think this will make   suddenly feel the need to visit Gap?    Dawna Austin Hey.. here's my version of a good new logo.. http://i.huffpost.com/gen/207122/thumbs/s-GAP-mini.jpg     Jason Buck Here's my 2 cents  http://www.jasonbuck.net/gaplogo.jpg   Jon Romano The logo is awful. I joined just to tell you. The blue box to honor your past? That's a really bad joke. The font looks like the  erican Apparel one, too. Nice job aiming down. Redo.   Elisa D'Alessandro Here's an idea, go back to the old logo. Your new shitty tech looking logo that IS NO WHERE NEAR contemporary looks like a 12 year old opened up Microsoft Word, typed three letters and added in a box after. Your old logo was ICONIC and     Emily Hart Mcginnis keep the old logo. there is no reason to change. logos create continuity and recognition. your new logo looks like a bland computer firm who couldn't afford to pay a decent designer. blah.   Paul Jones What a sh e - the new Gap logo looks so cheap I'm embarrassed to shop there. It's sort of like when Walmart tried to go 'u arket' with faux-wood shelf displays only in reverse.     Yvette Webster So you've launched a new, insipid and generic logo and you're now asking for submissions for more ideas on design?   Douglas Bonneville I just won Gap's crowdsourcing contest!http://bonfx.com/gaps-new-crowdsourced-logo-unveiled-after-rebranding-fail/    Lisa Szcepanski Looks cheap! Does that mean your jeans will be cheap too? I wouldn't mind spending 10 dollars on a pair of jeans!    Kevin Kelpe genius.    Lynn Mathiowetz Hoffman What   gave you such terrible advice? I actually never shop at the GAP for me or my husband- not my style- but the kids clothes (2 year old twins and 4 year old) it's there or Old Navy. I can't believe they'd think that a logo would make a difference (though it could make me NOT want to shop there)- but seriously, it's the product you're buying that matters-not the logo on the door. Unreal.     aranthe Wolff This new logo is terrible and  ateurish. The other one is classic and timeless. Will be a huge mistake to change it. I will boycott your stores if you switch. Don't fall victim to the rebranding bullshit someone is feeding you.    Reuven Stafford   .well ,on the bright side, it's not QUITE as bad as Seattle's Best's new logo     Ethan Clark Pick one of these!http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9vio1cuKt1qe4cbio1_400.jpg    Paige Luttrell Hideous!!!     Erin No'ebl Shale Fitzgerald HELVETICA    Tiffany Robertson Love it so much that I don't see it on this page anywhere? Wow, what a corporate response we love our version REALLY? You can't change what you don't acknowledge, admit it sucks and get back to the drawing board (or Microsoft Works, yes WORKS, not WORD because WORD could do better than this)!!   Antoine Clyburn HOW ABOUT THIShttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7RZnxI8x7Xk/TK5-c0Y9XRI/AAAAAAAAAUs/DqTNp9yXS4U/s1600/GAP+LOGO.JPG   Haunted Haight Walking Tour When you posted - Gap Thanks for everyone's input on the new logo! We've had the s e logo for 20+ years, and this is just one of the things we're changing. We know this logo created a lot of buzz and we're thrilled to see passionate debates unfolding! So much so we're asking you to share your designs. We love our version, but we'd like to see other ideas. Stay tuned for details in the next few days on this crowd sourcing project. ----- WILL I BE PAID FOR A NEW DESIGN YOU LIKE?????????    Melissa A. Lopez Absolutely HATE the new version!! You MUST CHANGE it back to the old version!! THIS IS A TRADEMARK; A CLASSIC THIS IS what GAP IS EVERYONE recognizes GAP with the old trademark design PLEASE DON'T TRY TO FIX SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BROKEN!!   Jennifer C den Wagner No, NO, no, NONONONONO!!! Horrible, terrible. Take it back.     Alicia Britner Roseler I think they should just stick to the old one.     Gil Oxo Here is one. http://tinyurl.com/28gnvr6     Rodericka Applewhaite change it please    Delisa Richardson Have you guys ever heard of Pepsi Clear and NEW Coke yeah Google it! Keep the old logo.    Xavier Cummings I can't believe how flipping stupid the new logo is. After being a GAP customer for many years, I will no longer purchase a thing if they continue with this stupid, ugly, new coke type of bad idea    Dallas Fashion-Editor new LOGOBig thumbs down    Christina Osen Igboin Who cares! I go to Gap for the clothes not the logo!    Michael Steven Chavez What were you hoping to achieve with this change? If it was marketing buzz, congratulations - you achieved your goal! If it was to piss of your existing customer base, congratulations - you excelled at that!Branding is such a complex (a   Jay Ferris Read the Huffington Post editorial. What a bunch of corporate jibba jabba, to paraphrase BA Barakus. What a terrible redesign of a classic logo that should have just been left alone.   Sallie Tullo-Colas Really? Are you kidding! You went from cadillac to trailer park trash with this one.   Laura Wickett That 20+ year logo IS your identity. Some things you just do not change. They might be modified slightly to update their look, but not changed. The new logo is stupid and ugly. Really ugly, uncreative, uninspiring, and just plain BLAH. KEEP THE OLD LOGO or just tweak it to update it. It IS the Gap that I have loved and shopped at for many many years!!   Spencer Hill To be direct: if you keep this logo, I will stop shopping at your stores.   T mi Bateman Harper NO NO NADA NEVER NO WAY PLEASE DON'T!!    Cathy Anne LaGuardia The Gap log is an  erican Icon - don't change it!     Jordan Nelson An open letter:Gap,Cut the crap. You say that you love our version but want to hear other opinions. Bill Chandler, your VP of corporate communications, has said in an interview with fastcodesign.com that you all stand by your new logo w   Lisa Sebasco Really? You DID NOT pay someone to design the new logo. Your marketing te  patched it together to create some buzz so that there'd be a public outrage and someone would give you a great new design for free. The Marketing department calls it crowdsourcing. Clever. Now how about throwing a little bit of money at a logo design?   Anna Moers Kopec Coming from a designer standpoint OMG..Why? The serifs where classic as is the clothing line you present and now you have helvetica with a gradient square. Why try to present yourself as something you are not? I   a fan of Gap and your logo has been branded, which is a feat many company's seek why change? and lose any recognition you've gained in how many years?     Rachel Beser You want to be generic like a lot of web 2.0 logos. Your logo has to work on fabric, paper and web, but should stand put and be recognizable as this is gap and not Microsoft. You are a huge brand and are demeaning the design industry by getting opinions from followers. I too joined this to comment. If you are going to change the logo that scre s classic blue jeans to me, spend the money and do the work. Some advice for companies, Serif does not equal bad.    Molly Wahl Wow - please please please say that this is a rediculous attempt to generate publicity and not actually true. This is just another reason why I don't shop at the GAP that much - you're not staying true to the brand you have been and the modern classics you have always offered. I have been a GAP shopper for well over 20 years (holy crap!) and I remember when you introduced the new (old) logo - its iconic - please don't change it!    Sheryl Segal Moncarz So this is supposed to be the GAP's thinking OUTSIDE THE BOX????    Morgan Elizabeth I dont like the new logo because it looks too techy. I understand the concept of incorporating the old blue background into the new logo design, however - keep the s e font style maybe? Since this change is happening whether we like it o    Brad Zavakos Can't wait to submit something more appropriate for the line! The new version looks terrible     Brett Mosser the new logo looks very CHEAP. it makes the whole brand seem like a joke.    Court Sloger Just make quality clothes. Please. Forget these marketing ploys. Just say hey, we're making our clothes last this much longer! What a concept!    Jaime Pinnock Don't change the logo..change the clothes modern and clean is always good..with a bit of frill here and there. Add a new line--like Banana did with BR Monogr , but don't change the big blue logo.    Summer Dawn I can only imagine how this is going to look hovering over the stores  ongst a nice mall with nice shops like Banana Republic or Nordstrom's       T aria Banks-Larder New logo is awful. Best word to describe it .GENERIC.     Vidya Santosh As a child of the 90s, I grew up with the fall into the gap fall into the gap commercials. The original logo to me symbolizes the cool clothes my mom would never buy for me. The new logo is more like the used computer store down the street. All in all, I would say Gap made a great move here. I don't even know why they are trying to crowd source when their secretary with Microsoft Word designed such a fabulous mark for them. Really. Why.   Vidya Santosh P.S. Brad Savakos: submit something and you cheapen what it is you do for a living. I mean, if Brad Pitt offered to take me home and then dump me out the next morning I have enough self-respect that I might say yes..then I'd be using him  But this is different! You're better than they are. Don't do it.    Tawanda Smith Goosby Do a change that MAKES SENSE!!!!!!!    Shannon Kiang It's hideous and cheap-looking. Make it go away. Want the old one back. Now. Thanks.     Zoe Yoo I \f2 \uc0\u9829   your stuff! please look at my picture. http://thefastertimes.com/nonsensenews/files/2009/11/gap-logo.jpgCHANGE IT TO THIS!   Zoe Yoo and  , seriously, this logo looks AWFUL! i mean it looks like a    Zoe Yoo i didn't want to say    Holly Dennis Peebles Love the GAP, HATE the new logo. How about having a sale if numbers are down instead of changing the look. Sheesh.    Charity Michot You don't need a new logo. If you did, you should hire a real ad agency and not try to sc  freelancers. Branding fail.     Rachel Bergen Ryan I like the old logo fine- why do we need to change? I always loved gap growing up until now and I want my kids to feel the s e way. I say new logo is a no-no!    Landon Hester Gap's New Logo  Like My First Grade Project, But not as Cool    Rachel Sapiente Rickert Was this epic failure intentional? How insulting to produce ugliness then suggest the design community fix your mistakes for free. Thankfully, the few morons who've created logos on this thread have not yet learned as much as Nancy, your company receptionist has to teach them about design & marketing in an MS fr work. Just gag. Let's see you produce something classic and sleek, please.   Fashawna  s GAP is my ALL wether for myself or my kids  the LOGO I can care less about as long as you continue to carry all the funkiest clothes for me and my kids the LOGO does'nt matter it's what's in the store that keeps me coming back OLD N    Gwendolyn Simone Farrell Not liking the new Logo. Why change something that identifies the brand for so many years. Don't change something that works so well!!!!    Dianna Davenport If it ain't broke, don't fix it .If this is a permanent change, I'll shop elsewhere.   Mike Czuboka Not buying this at all. This logo is so bad that it's not even believable. I think this whole thing is a clever marketing ploy to create some viral buzz on the net, and looks like its working.   are fired right up about this, but if you look at their website, they've only changed the logo in once place in the nav. Companies this big don't partially launch a logo in this way.   Nikki Trivette That new logo is just plain FUGLY! :/    Joshua Eric Wilson Some things just don't need to be changed.    Rita Carlson Rothzen Keep the old logo that's how I know it's from The Gap. Do not change what works!!    Nito Edwards Does this mean that we can share it and you pay us for the one you like  sort of like a contest?    Jose Werdplae Lucio http://craplogo.me/    Jose Werdplae Lucio Want your own crappy logo? http://craplogo.me/    Megan Groesbeck The new logo is a big mistake - it sucks. Totally violates marketing principle of branding. I don't get why you guys are shooting yourselves in the foot like this.    Frank Algernon Helvetica is played out, Goudy Bookletter is where it's at. http://tier7.net/crGAP.jpg    Victor Stuber Seriously first you change an iconic logo. then you try to get   to make you a new one for free. Keep your old logo and stop wasting our time   Phu Le When I look at the new logo I think law firm. how ridiculous.    Taylor Barnes You all are ridiculous. The old Gap logo reminds the world of how the old Gap was. If anyone understands anything about the retail business, it's that it's constantly changing. And Gap Inc. brand stores are definitely NOT what they used to     Raymond Carlos Abagat What a TACKY and TASTELESS logo.    Chelsea 'Sherry' Beets I like the original GAP logo and even though it has been around for over 20 years I still don't see that as a reason to change it. The original is better then the newest one in my opinion.    Kimo Sabe Sorry the new logo looks cheap and it is not recognized.The old one wasn't broken so why fix it.Everyone knows the old one it's the recognized one on how it stands through time.The old logo was the logo period. I bet GAP never knew that many countries like Pan a like to sport the GAP paper bag cause of it's design. Now it has a China looking logo. Good luck with that.    Ces Aguilar seriously? the old one is classic  the new one? it seems like it was done in 60 seconds      Makenzie Cruze Flores The new logo is so bad! The font is great, but the small blue square in the top right corner, seriously? YUCK!    Sassi Chickadee That logo is awful absolutely awful     Rebecca Utka i hate this new logo!!!!!!!!!    Dedrean Blu Dixon Heres my take on the New Logo!http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=7289105&l=a3a28219e5&id=639271320    Danielle Spinetta don't change it - and if you do .don't use that one!    Rebecca Utka i hate this logo, so much of my clothing is from gap    Erika Themaras Crowd sourcing? are you fucking serious?.. you probably paid $200,000 to a design firm for that sorry excuse for logo and now you want another one for free, designers,   are free. Fuck you Gap, move to fucking China, we dont need your crowd sourcing here.   Jay Ng I love the new logo. HA, just kidding, it sucks. Reminds me of a cheap 90's Microsoft PowerPoint template. They knock it off.     Courtney Beadel Epic fail.Obviously needs more gradient (j/k).Good luck with your crowdsourcing plans. Hope they will fail as spectacularly as that new piece of logo-dung.   Mike Warren Your marketing dept. could have saved millions of $, cuz thats how much Im sure you spent to get a square box and different font change. Have you still not learned from the other huge companies out there who did good on going back to what customer outcry was. Obviousy change is not always good. Dont let your ego/pride get in the way, drop the new logo and you can still write off the millions of $ come tax time!     Meg Young Just like the womens fall collection. Boring, boring, boring.    Queenie Lo wtf ur management r thinking when comin' up such a horrible idea? i'll give more credit to MS office clipart, stuff are much better than this horrible logo!!     Colin Whitlock Your old logo was crisp, clean, classic. It was well designed and easily distinguished. The new one looks cheap and quite forgettable. Don't mess with perfection. If it ain't broke .     Anoop Sinha here's my idea for your new logo, http://imgur.com/1ndCr   Tonya Snow-Cook yeah, not feeling this new logo at all don't want to see it stitched in any of my clothes either. Liked the old logo didn't need to be changed. Leave well enough alone!!!!!!!!!    Evolette Sanchez Personal opinion  old logo looks better! It's classic GAP no need for changes.    Jill Paszek-Harrod It's really almost traumatic! It doesn't go! The old one is simple, classy. Gosh, please change it back. I don't think I can stomach buying clothes from your store anymore, not with that logo. I feel betrayed! Doesn't KMart use that font??    Khiem Hoang new logo is no good go back to the original logo     Anthony Papas http://www.anthonypapas.com/gap_logo.jpg   Shad Petosky L e. Good design comes from good clients. You execute something that uninspired and then ask for another one for free? You don't need a new logo, you need a new CMO. This is insulting to designers and their livelihood. Oh, Hey  No one likes my clothes, will you give me some free clothes?     Nick Versteeg Here's my Gap logo. I just made it on MS Paint in my spare time, but I'm pleasantly surprised with how it c e out. Judge for yourself. http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=116522&id=699596997#!/photo.php?pid=7170311&id=699596997&fbid=477761976997   Helaine Marucci Henry I've been a GAP kid since 4th grade and now many years later I still considered it my favorite store. However, I do not like the new logo the old one is the one I've grown up with and love. Change it back!    Johnathan Gibbs It looks like you made it from Microsoft Clip Art!    Jordan Gardiner Your entire design staff have gone completely stupid. If you all weren't all yes men, you would see this too. Go bloody fire them already.. and maybe fire yourselves too.     Steve McMillen Microsoft Clip Art or Word Art would be advanced. This logo could have been done in WordPerfect for DOS -- no Windows, no mouse.     Victor Murithi I think that new logo is an online marketing c paign to create buzz & attention on the Gap brand. To stimulate emotions in loyal Gap fans, how many of you are thinking let me go buy 1 or 2 jeans from Gap, b4 they change the logo. Even if its 10% of you thats a considerable victory for their sales te  and social media footprint.     Dizzy Man The new logo is simply awesome. It makes me think that we are in the 21'st century, not year 1980. The logo is simple yet catchy. Very nice design, no matter it was created in Microsoft Word for $17 or it was worth hundreds maybe even thousands of $. Good job!    Stephanie Dejewski The new logo scre s CHEAP!!!!!!!!! You   have a marketing problem, fire the idiots!   Carlos L ont Jackson I   a graphic designer from Chapel Hill NC. Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to share my logo design idea for GAP - Here is the link -http://picasaweb.google.com/jacksonlcarlos/Logos#5525590077439453506   Vidith Girard dislike this marketing idea was a waste of valuable time and money. GAP officially lost it appeal and quality it looks like a joke. I could have come up with this crap     Gabriele Schmidt Robinson Stick with the Original ~ Think McDonald's, Chic-fil-A and Coke. Change is not always good. Kudos to bringing GAP to the forefront and kick starting right before the holidays. Maybe the marketing department's strategy is working after all? Do another 50% off jeans instead of pouring any more money into this new logo. It looks cheesy and cheap. Stick with GAP ~ Fall into the GAP. The GAP, for me, stands for Genuine And Practical. Now, there's an idea!   Jeremy Owens The new logo is awful. Looks like something I could have made in middle school computer class! The old GAP logo is a trademark signature for the company!     Michael Ellis http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/9910/gap.png LMAO, this is Pepsi all over again. How many millions will it cost for signage, print, commercials etc etc? And how well does the new logo translate over in the real world. Because it's not doing such a hot job in the virtual space.   Rachel Lowry When I first saw the new logo, my reaction was literally, That is awful. Oh, and the crowd-sourcing thing - getting the crowd to design a logo for you or to fix the problem? That's total and complete B.S. Either go back to the original     Veronica Bradley I worked for the company for over 20 yrs and just like me out with the old and in with the new~whoever is in charge of this will be sorry if they change it. When something good is staring you in the face then you should embrace it , somethings are good just the way they are.     Erika Hogan I'm more concerned about the gradient than the helvetica. Anyone with an associate's degree in communication design knows that a gradient is not a design element.   Erika Hogan and also, whoever designed it originally should redesign it or be replaced by someone with talent. you're a major corporation, you shouldn't be asking consumers to clean up your mess.   Lesley Whyard borrrrrrrrrrrring     Bibi Reyes hate the new logo, looks like something from a l e powerpoint presentation.   Joshua Lawrence Bernal Perez  .ew.Does this mean that you're going to sell COMPUTER PROGR S as well????   Kimberly Griffin You have a classic logo that is recognized around the world, and while   don't always see it this way, it really is the face of your company. Why would you change it to something that the consumers obviously dislike instead of keeping one of the most easily recognizable logos in fashion industry? Whatever the reasoning is, it should be known that not all things in this world need to be modernized and updated, and not all updates equal improvment (Windows Vista proved that already).     Theodore Develegas Here's what I think of the new logo http://bit.ly/bIqgkp   Jackie Jiaqi The new logo's quite gross     Gj Nelson This MUST be a publicity stunt. No one would seriously choose this as a new logo.   Gj Nelson It will cost millions to make the switch. It's two colors making it twice as costly to reproduce. It has a gradation  A GRADATION! Making it difficult to create in three dimensional signage. It has a dark color over a dark color. It says nothing about the brand. What makes it contemporary? Using the world's oldest Sans Serif font? Does using the world's most commons Sans Sarif make it outstanding? Hardly. My god. It's just all wrong. I know this is a joke. New coke? New Tropicana cartoon? Just a bad dre ?   Cee C p I thought I'd share my logo as well https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-better-gap-logo-community-project-54693/entries/895   Brittany Shaw You wanted to bring it into the future, but Helvetica is a font that has been overused and is very dated. The gradient is disastrous! I would not like to wear that logo on my shirt. If anything your old logo is the best thing about the GAP. It is the icon that draws me into the store (even if I don't want to over pay for jeans).     Genevieve Goldk p Who signed off on that? I would never go into a store with that logo on it unless (as others have written) I was going to buy software.   Frank Peter Ortiz C,mon guys, you are making the 12 year old that designed this logo FEEL REAL BAD !    J es Young  Crowdsourcing, especially if your plan is to open it up as winner take all spec work (see: http://www.no-spec.com/), is a very bad idea in terms of dealing w/ your perceived backlash at the new design.It's an insult to the   who mak   Jen Mooney Dimler Your new logo doesn't say anything about who your brand really is. Really disappointing.     Karen Martinez i dont like the new logo, it looks cheap!..the old one is better     Randi Justus Glazer Ryan You wasted time, money and effort redesigning something that was already working. If it ain't broke - DON'T fix it! WHO would want such an ugly logo in their clothes? I mean REALLY!! The person who suggested a logo redesign should be fired!    Richard Lang hahahaha! social media is the stoning of our time :)    Derek Johnson Don't you feel awkward when you use debates so loosely? I mean, debates usually have the for to, well, debate with the against? Doesn't seem much like a passionate debate! as you describe. Tropicana did the right thing. Don't be a Xerox     Olivia Pleasants Whiteside The new logo is AWEFUL! Why the change? It is unrecognizable the old logo was perfection. Changing your logo is a disasterous move like McDonalds changing the classic M to green with points!    Bonnie Carter I'm a professional designer and usually I don't mind the crowdsourcing reference - it certainly separates our clients from those who buy into the idea their brand is worth a few hundred, or gee a design contest sounds like fun - 1 winner    Carol Thuney Well this is brilliant in that it gives them a gigantic free focus group and loads of new design ideas for those of you willing to put them on here .I for one will refrain       Erica Storey Velker Not so cute ;-(     Katrina MsUnderstood Lawson  *sigh* Mi no likey     Thurston Murphy So why is the old logo still on this facebook page?     Sarah J. Watson The new logo really does look like something a high school student created in MS in 1999 - not good at all.    Doug Bing an Looks great if you were a big chemical giant type business ( thats the first impression I get when I see it) I love your jeans but do not want that logo anywhere near it. Your old logo is classic (20 yrs) and you change it for GENERIC?      Matt Dillon My suggestion morph the British Mind the Gap sign, ie maybe put a modern spin on the red circle with the blue banner through it, which maintains the blue Gap has always used. You could make it look worn. Think it would be trendy than the new block logo.    Molly Flick Tippner Love Helvetica. Don't love the SQUARE.    Olga Chengstein Klenova The little blue square is ODD! Please change back to the old logo!     Lisa DeSollar Cagnina New logo -very bad. Don't mess w/classic.     Julie Davidson But the best part about your logo is that it IS iconic. It has stood the test of time. You can be modern and evolving without losing sight of where you c e from and what your brand stands for and what we all love it for. It's one thing to evolve - but if you're going to change the face of what GAP is and what it stands for I think you will have bigger problems than a botched logo.     Lisa DeSollar Cagnina oh and another thing- not only is it noticeable that some of your t-shirt products' quality gone done (cheap, thin) now your logo scre s *CHEAP*    Robert Mohns In a nutshell: New logo is http://yfrog.com/b7i0bp '97Gradients are so 2007, and Helvetica on white is nice but Crate & Barrel already are that look. Back to the drawing board, and this time, don't do it by committee. Just put one person with taste on it.    Drew Miller Really, if you are going to change it, at least make it simple enough so it can be easily reproduced like this: http://drewmillermedia.com/gap     Gilles Moriceau instead of changing your perfect logo for an ugly and uninteresting one, please, rev p your stores which are really outdated !   Coki Balaka HERES THE NEW FACE OF GAP. CONTACT ME IF YOU LIKE IT12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MAKING GRAPHIC DESIGNhttp://imagefrog.net/show.php/121338_GAPLOGO.jpg     Kimmy Tutu I do not like it at all .not at all  I have been a loyal GAP purchaser since, gosh, its been a long time, there was a time GAP was all I wore, lol Still \f2 \uc0\u9829   your brand, but HATE the new logo. I   a stickler for classic .the logo was fine and I see no reason why you all changed it.     Kelly Ciach Tundo Why would you mess with such a classic logo. Everyone knows the blue bag with the 3 white letters. I'm greatly disappointed in the change. I thought the s e logo meant you had faith in your clothing line and you stood by your product while all the others are changing to fit the current style. Keep the classic, drop the new. Btw, my 8 year old nephew could have designed something way better with a blank sheet of paper and a box of craoyla crayons.   Sheila Germain Crowdsourcing to possible publicity stunt, this is a train wreck no matter how you look at it.   Sarah Lewis The new logo has completely alienated me as a frequent Gap shopper. Since 80% of my wardrobe is Gap, my identity is therefore indirectly tied to the store. This logo is cheap and looks like something a design intern in the 1980s would hav    Maria Wallace The new logo is AWEFUL! Changing branding and logo will not increase sales. Gap's prices have significantly increased over the past 3 years. It was nice to be able to go into a store and get a good quality pair of jeans for, say $50.00 MAX! Now, you can't spend at least $80 for a pair. Give me a break! Why don't you just go ahead and change Old Navy and Banana Republic's logo while you're at it since it's the s e company? I think a 3 year old created the new logo. Helvetica font? Honestly?    Lori Haines Nope, sorry, the new logo sucks.    Rachael Marie Wiggins Flowers It looks like the person(s) in charge of the redesign completely forgot about their assignment, so they just threw that together real quick! Or, maybe their kid did it for them  Seriously GAP, how much did you waste on this? Hell, I'm n     Brian Warren The new logo is really bad but  The buzz created by releasing it was brilliant. Great job GAP! They aren't changing their logo, they're getting us to talk about them before the shopping season.    Kourtney Despres I agree with many of the previous comments. You have the budget to spend on rebranding, so why not make it count? Helvetica comes standard on any design software and that's why so many   use it! If you want your brand to stand out, go the extra mile and pay for a reputable firm. This literally looks like an intern with no experience created it.     Troy Slate looks like dollar general     J'e9r'e9mie Monein Il pue ton nouveau logo     Toi Powell These comments are out right hilarious!!!! Just like the new logo out right hialrious!    Brian Inman Logo FAIL   Dave Punk if anyone knows anything about design, you know that this logo is absolute crap- including the designers who worked on it. They dont care, they probably made 100K up to a Million on it. This clearly is a product of some suit in corporate  erica controlling design that doesnt know his ass from a hole in the ground. Sad. Very sad Gap, good job keeping your integrity. ;)    Kayla Bill Your previous logo already has so much recognition and changing it that drastically could be fatal. Instead consider keeping the basic logistics of your logo and perhaps  p up your type face. Check out work by Doyald Young  it's his specialty and he could clean up this disaster.    Ali Makahleh dude it's sooo simple KEEP THE OLD ONE!!!!it's what makes GAP more interesting!!! O_o     Dave Punk and share your logo so they can steal it??? Riiiight   get a clue. Gap, hire a real design studio, and let them do their job. Stick to your craft, make clothes. Let designers design.   Caleb Paquette Yes, but anyone who knows anything about fashion knows that retailers aren't making money on just selling, higher end, sleek, iconic pieces anymore, which is exactly what GAP's old logo was. Consumers are responding much better right now     Aimee McEwen Most professional designers would take offense to your crowdsourcing/design contest and from a promotion stand point this is a really l e attempt. The classic Gap logo should be refreshed, not redesigned. No spec! http://www.no-spec.com/   Christian Messer First off - a Fortune 500 company turning to crowd sourcing is pathetic. You know better and should be ash ed. Second, you used a frickin' gradient! How exactly are you going to reproduce that on leather labels on the back of jeans? Stick with your old logo - at least you know how to use it properly'85stop asking designers or fans to submit free possibilities.   Christine Patronick Gap, you say you like to see passionate debate unfolding- there is no debate. The logo is not working, I have seen no one debating that it is a complete failure.     Jennifer Evans I only bec e a fan to make this comment. I   APPALLED that you are crowd sourcing designers for a new logo. It degrades the work that designers do and makes actually paying for good design work seem like a thing of the past. And to all designers that are trying to do a logo  sh e on you! A contest to design a logo means you are being taken for granted. I will never shop at Gap again.   Dave Punk I agree with Aimee. Caleb, the logo does not mean that at all, you must work for Gap. :P A Logo is only a part of it, branding and marketing strategy is part of it too.    Jan Murphy The new logo is dreadful.    Seth Holder It looks like a logo for a drug company or an oil company. NOT fashion forward. Make it work.   Sally 'Richardson' Robbins Please consider going back to your old logo. I   a long-time customer of Gap and a marketing professional. I love the timeless, classic designs that have made your brand great and your old logo completely conveys this image.    Bunny Nguyen Why a debate if you've already decided on this change? I used to shop at the Gap many years ago, and this will certainly not make me go back.     Willi son Dulc'e9 rev ping a logo is the most difficult task in design no wonder why Coca cola still got the s e logo after a 100 years. They went to far in the change   no longer relate. Rev ping is normally a slight change of the logo nothing to drastic.    Artenza DreadChic Muh mad What the heck were u guys thinking? This logo SUCKS!!! My 3 year old could have did that on her Leapfrog! I think I smell some pink slips being issued to the marketing department for this crap! Old Navy here I come with my money!!    Dean Flowers the new logo looks awful!     Maisha Martin Well all i can say is that i'm excited to try my own hand at redesigning for ya, shoot dont gotta pay me i just want the braggin rights XD well good luck either way :)    Colleen Davidson Looks like it was done in PowerPoint, please tell me this is a joke!     Akshay Anikhindi The introduction of the new logo will be better received if you pair it with this:Gap: Because we've run out of inspiration and you're shopping at J. Crew anyway   Lisa Wright Willard Looks like one of those my-neighbor's-nephew's-girlfriend's-brother is a designer, and can create a new logo for you really cheap. Wow. The logo went from iconic, slim and stre lined to bulky, with a bad usage of Helvetica with a nonsensical blue box? How about just updating the stores? Wait, maybe even fashionable clothing IN the stores.     Novei M Carvalho I really don't undderstand why change something that after all these 20 years, is still modern, and to which we can relate. Not a sign of modern thinking in my opinion. If it's one thing that should not be changed in the new GAP, it should be the logo E.R. Flynn I think what drives me insane more that the lousy gap logo redesign is the fact that you guys are asking for folks to design a new one gratis. You know what? You're a multimillion dollar corporation and you can AFFORD TO PAY for your logo   Sara Thomas If it's between the old logo and this new one, keep the old logo! If you're going to rev p it, then go at it with the s e style I have seen coming out of your stores lately. I've been pretty impressed with the quality and style of clothi    Erika Themaras PS you shouldn't have to explain a logo, that is what conceptualizing is for, to get to the point where you achieve the message in the logo at first glance.    Tiff Rogers Does the Gap know that in classrooms, they're usually the prime ex ple of what NOT TO DO in building a loyal apparel consumer base? Here is just another ex ple professors will be able to use.    Liza Heider What's up with the blue box?    Grace Giulini Cox Dislike    Kate Steward Logan Why change something so iconic?    Carroll Ray What a great way to make a bad situation worse. Take advantage of a horrible decision by inviting   to donate their creative talents for free. Are you going to pay the person if you decide to use their design instead? Sad commentary on the times, and on your company.    Mike Oliver Crowdsourcing? Are you a multi-million dollar clothing chain or a used car lot?   Hern'e1ndez Carlos Poor!    Doug Noble i hate it    Shelley Wood O'Neill Branding branding branding your brand is strong. Don't change the logo.     Nabou Faye NON au nouveau logo,on pr'e9f'e8re le carr'e9 bleu denim!

Seriously. Then take that money and put it into product design. Money better spent.     Ashley D Schrecengost Its hideous, it looks cheap and generic. The outrage is justified.    Roberto Barazzuol Hi, my n e is Roberto Barazzuol, from Italy.I   the designer that back in the 1988 in San Francisco designed the GAP logo.The logo bec e a real icon in the field of fashion for 20 years.   Latisha Taylor Changing the logo could affect the loyalty of reliable customers. The new design looks cold, uninviting, and takes the luxury out of the brand. You should really consider changing it back.     Latisha Taylor The new logo really doesn't go with the classic designs that you sale.     Joe Rossomando So I was wondering where you guys bought that logo making progr  from? My friend's 8 year old needs a cheap looking logo for his book report. Come on Guys hire a design agency and get a nice logo. Other wise stick with what you have.     Chelsea McKenzie  @Akshay - love your suggested tagline! haha@Willi son - your sooo right, a redesign is much be more delicate then a new one. Since your dealing with a lot of existing brand equity, of the design te  needs to be a good steward!

I liked the GAP facebook page just so I could comment. I went to the GAP homepage just to see the logo. MARKETING STUNT ALERT!    Andreea Si Eduard http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-better-gap-logo-community-project-54693/entries/1157   Whitney Michael This is the worst idea GAP has ever had. I will be sad to see this change take place. I will say that if this logo is brought into the clothing I will no long be shopping with the GAP. Really a bummer because 90% of my clothing has been      Kristy Tillman Asking for free designs!? lmao    Gj Nelson Whitney  this the BEST idea GAP has ever had! It's a marketing stunt. Don't worry - this is NOT their new logo.   Gj Nelson Social interaction on their facebook page and web site has gone up 1000% since they introduced their fake new logo. It's a brilliant marketing stunt.     Ndu Multimedia Well if this is a marketing strategy to recreate awareness, then it worked. But if this is a serious decision, then it's the worst idea. It's not about being an ugly logo or not, it's about changing authenticity.    Drew An Zoom in on my Profile Pic. I think this would cause me to enter a store and not walk by it     Dwight T Knowlton Microsoft would do well to leverage the fact that GAP's new logo was done in MS Paint.   Kyra Poulos I feel sad that the logo is changing -- it seems completely unnecessary!!     Andrew Mclean read about the controversy with the new logo, so thought id quickly give it a shot and create another logo. Personally i found the new GAP to be pretty generic and sterile, with heavy, bland lettering. I've gone with a more stre line look    Melody Nieves Viable marketing stunts aren't supposed to piss   off..lol FAIL!

Melody Nieves But if it is a cheap marketing ploy you've just given   hope that they can have a stab at rebranding the world f ous GAP stores way to make   waste their afternoon. I'm sure   are just going to run out and buy clothes now!    Erin Rae Jumper Please tell me there will be another logo coming soon because that new one is not working.    Danielle Del'Andrae Rothe As I read all these outraged comments about a logo change I laugh. I honestly haven't stepped foot in a GAP in a long time With GAP changing things up a bit, I now want to pay a visit to my local store. Maybe thats what they wanted to do all along. Spark an interest. Their n e is now all over the place. The media is so predictable. So many   make fun of the Simplicity of the new logo. Have you looked at the old? A blue box with typewriter white font. Come on a change isn't going to hurt anything.     ber Foster It looks like its a logo for a computer company, not a clothing line. Gap is going to lose a lot of loyal shoppers over this change.     anda Hartman No, I really don't think this is a marketing stunt. First off, it's all BAD attention. Unlike being a celebrity, bad attention for a brand is.. well  bad. Second, do not underestimate the ability for corporate  erica to fail at cool. Are you mom and dad cool? No.. I didn't think so.    T mi Ortiz I personally love the old logo. It's recognizable by a million miles away and that takes logivity to build that kind of recall. The new logo doesn't look special and I grew up thinking GAP was pretty special. Not to mention I worked there o   Mara Braish It looks like a cheap gas station logo  or better yet something Wal-mart would change to. (((change is great but ONLY when ur IMPROVING something, not RUINING it.)))   Juli Martin dont try and defend a bad choice to change your logo its ugly listen to the   now     Juli Martin ITS BUTT ASS UGLY .seriously..did all of GAP headquarters fall down and smack their head on the pavement?    Kim Glen So let me get this straight. You completely rev ped the logo from something trusted and recognizable to something a 13-year-old created in PowerPoint (apologies to 13-year olds), and now you want   to redo the logo, after you already released it? Oh yeah, and not get paid the millions of dollars you paid the agency to give you a crap logo?     Aida Dujarric Brilliant marketing ploy!

You'd see it from afar & think, yes, I know that. The new logo looks like an insurance company logo We have the best Gap coverage anywhere! Yuck! Why fix what ain't broke? Also brings back memories of New Coke and we all know how hard that tanked!    Beth Pototo Don't change the logo - this is a great point from Styleite: The think about brand identities is that the really good ones shouldn't have to change. When was the last time Hermes changed its logo? Or H&M? Or Vogue magazine, for that matter? The new logo looks like you're dealing in computer hardware - it does not make me want to buy clothes.    Allison Greene Cote Dislike! Looks cheap.    Kristen Curtze This confuses me. I believed this was a crowd-sourcing effort from the start after first seeing this god awful logo.

Joanne Martinez Von Gonten New and improved is NOT always better sometimes something f iliar and comfortable is what brings   back. This is one of those times. Your original logo is iconic and speaks to the classic looks you have become known for. Spend your money on bringing quality back (that has been lost over the last few years), and your sales will go up. It is that simple. I hope your identity folks did not charge you alot of money for the logo, because it is a waste of your money. INDIVIDUALITY!!!    Kristi Klenchik Steele I like the old GAP Logo better but no one likes change. I don't dislike the new LOGO. And a LOGO will not change how much I LOVE and support the company and the awesome clothes. How petty   are being.   will get used to the change and become acustom to it - it won't even be an issue in a few months.     Michelle Ad ski Volk WOW, you actually paid someone to create this crap?? They should be fired! It's ugly and looks like something a 8yr old would make in MS paint     Guillermo Federico Rojas Coca-Cola and Ford have had the s e logo for much longer than 20 years, and they manage to keep the brand current. Why didnt you try that as well??    Armanda Costa notice how they wrote  we're asking you to share your designs. We love our version, but we'd like to  see other ideas. really, they LOVE their version, they are just trying to get   to waste there time on creating a free logo and this whole crappy new logo design is just major publicity stunt. everyones talking about it, mission accomplished GAP    Melanie Prucha Hergenrader the old logo was much better iconic     Rana Qat i I've seen photography books about Gap ad c paigns throughout the years  this just can't be true  so sad to see new   who claim they've got great ideas, so easily erase originality ! The Gap logo is not only iconic because it lasted, it's part of a culture  The future will look s gloomy if such a cheap design takes over  really!    Carroll Ray Starting to agree with Gj Nelson  this MUST be a marketing stunt. It is just not possible that anyone could have thought this was a good idea  then again  Tropicana made the s e mistake and stood by it.     Antonio Carpio Valladolid No me importa(http://facebook.com/fbosfEn)    Agnes DeToulouse RIDICUL'US ^^    Jason Schwartz Next time I go into the Gap I   going to ask for every article of clothing for free and only pay for the one that I like the most.Gap is devaluing the entire creative field by posting this. This is such a scary misstep for a big brand like   Ann Bergsagel McPherson Thanks for posting the classic logo again .you were scaring me with the other one! LOL! ;o)    Gj Nelson The new GAP logo is a HOAX. http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=160851527268087    Ruth Noemi Luquin I like the original logo! don't change it!    Joy Renee Selnick helvetica? seriously?well, at least it wasn't comic sans.     Mike Jarrell My ideas for the logo =) http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-better-gap-logo-community-project-54693/designers/472055    Yolanda Arterberry Nelson Stick to the original logo thanks   .    Morgan Thomas Why change something that was so classic? That's how   identify Gap.    Tracy Bonosconi The Gap brand has been sliding for years, from the quality of the clothing to the customer service in the store. To see the noted changes is hard, because gap has always been such an iconic brand. The new logo goes one step forward in what I believe has already been a cheapening of the brand.    Katie Christopher I don't see any reason to change something that works. New Coke anyone?    Susan Rivest Greger OK  the blue square looks like a piece cut from their shopping bag??    Rodney Finley This is inspiring! It let's me know that I too can one day redesign an established and recognizable logo! And I won't have to buy any more software because I already have Photoshop 2, MS Word, a huge clipart library, and a selection of 20 fonts!! Wow! And who needs talent!?? Saks Fifth Avenue  I got my eye on you!!! I'm gonna make millions!!!!!!   Jacqui Keskinen  ************Do not post new logos for Gap's benefit.

Why would a new logo (from a company with the background and history like GAP who is trying to mix it up) keep someone from shopping there? If you were a Gap customer in the past or someone that is looking to shop their line - I   not sure a new logo would bar you from shopping there. Just a thought .    Doug Levi I just don't understand why GAP would take something which is so identifiable by the public and remove it from their brand recognition.Here's my suggestion for a new logo:http://thefastertimes.com/nonsensenews/files/2009/11/gap-logo.jpg   Candy Irven Hauser Boo. Invest in better buyers not a new logo. Styles and sizing hasn't been great these days, which is disappointing and might be why the lag in sale. New logo not good.     Jared Delariman Here's an alternate version to the new logo that at least some   will love: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150096784144488&set=a.10150096784069488.316687.807999487   Dravin Nayak Actually nothing 2 say above comments are enough    Oliver Isaac White gay     ber-Lee C pbell helvetica? really? hop on that bandwagon!

Megan Selkey Don't ask designers to work for free! I expect that kind of thing from random relatives, but come on Gap - you should know better!   Kevin Chung My version: http://kevinclchung.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/the-gaps-new-logo-fixed/    Anne Thomas Epic FAIL   Heather Enlow Robbins How much is changing the logo gonna cost the consumer? I would personnally go with STENCIL font lol    Jared Delariman Embrace the new logo by making a GAP logo out of your own n e: http://craplogo.me/     Trisha Shuck Looks cheap!! Your product is better than that!! At least it was!!    Barbara Lima I hate the new logo !!! It makes it look cheap!!!!!     Heather Keyes Livingston The logo is horrible! It makes your website look worse than Wal-Mart!!!     Whitney Cowan Miller I love the original logo! I hate the new one so keep it the way it is.     Carole Walker Most companies would give their eye teeth to have such an identifiable logo. Why would you go and mess that up?   Drew Miller CHECK IT! If you are going to go and change it, have some taste. Here is my design on how it should look: http://drewmillermedia.com/gap    Drew Miller ps - gradients aren't smart for duplication and reproductions. especially on clothing. simple is king. elegance.    Kristin Poncek It's Gap to the gradient square power.Your attempt to save face by turning this into a crowd-sourcing project is ridiculous at best. Maybe your next selection will include Papyrus, the font of fake spas.   Candice Onodi I just graduated with a degree in graphic design from one of the leading design schools in the country and I know that if I was still going to school, we'd be having some pretty heated debates about this new logo. Since you're willing to se    Colleen McCaffrey Hate the new logo should have kept the old one.    Lisa Mirabile this logo was for shit    Sheila FitzPatrick Taney Horrible!    Danielle Dornier McCarty Ugh, don't like the GAP er uh Gap logo at all. :( So sad!    Allison Lyons I THINK THE NEW LOGO LOOKS LIKE A COMPUTER SOFTWARE LOGO NOT A CLOTHING ONE..I COULD HAVE C E UP WITH A BETTER ONE THAN THAT!    Cindy Holmes The s e logo for 20+ years is working. That logo is on boxes, shopping bags, advertising I think a better idea for changing would be to reverse the colors navy blue lettering over white. Whatever that thing you designed for the new logo is supposed to be, the   who shop at your stores don't like it. Those are the   you want to impress.   Andrzej Li\uc0\u347 kiewicz Is the new logo design inspired by MS Paint features?    Ernesto Fajardo Even though the previous logo was a simple typography composition, there's a nostalgia factor and I think THAT is the problem, how to change without making everyone feel dissapointed/angry. In my opinion, the new logo design has to be as clean and simple as the previous one but with a twist in the composition/shapes. I'd be thrilled to made my own version. I really hope the new logo you have announced is just a social-media experiment, because it's awful, seriously.   Felice Croul GAP has had such a great reputation for graphic design and communication, I can't believe you re-designed the logo so badly! On top of this you're devaluing the creative field by crowd sourcing the re-design of your corporate id. I agree    Bill Smith Please don't change your logo! The new one is not very good and the old one is iconic! Why would you do that??     Shorena Tsirekidze The new logo has no style, looks very primitive, reminds me of Toys-R-Us store logo for some reason. Not distinguished at all.     Elizabeth E T Robertson Keep the old one, please! Or at least another design. its horrible!    Andrew Kozlik I completely agree that you're devaluing the design field by asking   to work for you for free. Spec-work is the bane of the design industry, and it's incredulous that a corporation as large as Gap would stoop as low as this.I suggest   Casey-Lynn Saling Did the Gap receptionist make the new logo in between calls?   Dawna Austin Here's my version of a good logo:http://i.huffpost.com/gen/207122/thumbs/s-GAP-mini.jpg    Ginny Sak Vietti Can you say New Coke?     Mike Jarrell My versions  http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-better-gap-logo-community-project-54693/designers/472055   Krystelle B'e9gu'e9 Cacio don't change your old logo for the new one that looks old fashion. it is too plain. But change the cie that did this new logo for you ;).    Kristi Van Aken OMG. So now they admit it's awful, and they want a crowdsourced logo? Okay, deal. I'll go into the Gap and grab every shirt I see. If I get them home and decide I like one, I'll pay you a little something for it, but really, you should just be grateful that I'm wearing it'97forget about the hours it took to choose the color and fabric and sew the shirt. -Kristi Van Aken, graphic designer who now hates Gap.   Chin Tonquy PLEASE do not change your logo!You have better to fire the one who wants to redesign our logo.     Tiffany Chaney J es. Sorry but that's more suited for a graphics printing or computer company. This is retail. The new revision should at least transition more smoothly. I'm of the mind that a similar typeface in a slender serif could be utilized with the traditional blue box in a less dr atic way. Believe me, I love the experimental, but we're talking about redesigning a major brand. In light of what I've seen, stick with the old.     Jessica Bradley New logo is HORRIBLE!!!! There are some things you spice up & change-I understand that. Sometimes you don't change things &   respect the tradition. But if you are going to change, at least change for the BETTER, not worse?! I feel like this is a joke or publicity stunt. Fire the logo designer, they just stole your money! lol    Melody Sheridan Migas Keep it classic. The old one was fine.    Elsa Trawczetow pourquoi changer ce logo. c'est l'image m'eame de la marque. m'eame s'il n'a pas chang'e9 depuis 20 ans il reste actuel et repr'e9sente parfaitement les collections tendances et classique. Sans oublier la fiert'e9 de se balader avec son sac bleu GAP super pratique.    Ed Martinez http://www.brandingtailor.com/gap_logo.jpg   Michael Patrick Brady LOL    Elliot Quinn What is so wrong about the new logo? I think it's an improvement over the old one. I think it might have been better in all caps, but that's a judgment call.    Chris Oldt GAP has done two horrible things recently: One, is to have created an  ateurish new logo which completely trashes their brand; and Two, they have just insulted everyone ever involved with advertising, graphic design and branding by asking   to submit new logo ideas. To do it right, a designer needs to understand what the brand is about, to do that they need to work closely with the company they are designing for, not just randomly pick their favorite from   who know nothing about what the goals of the company are.   Allie Wright  We love our version, but we'd like to see other ideas  OK Gap just wants free ideas to correct their royal screw up in branding and save/recoup some money. LMAO   Erika Linden Green The new logo is hideous. Looks like it was done by a first year design student. I'm a professional designer, and if you want my redesign ideas you can PAY me for them.   Sunelkys Sonia No c bien please,la historia ha demostrado que existe en la sociedad la peur du changement,so, el viejo logo esta bien identifiable,alors que le nouveau est vraiment disgracieux :)    Shawn Benningfield I feel the old logo needed to be changed. I'm not sure the new one fits GAP's Brand, but it isn't the worst I've ever seen. I believe the new logo for GAP needs to be bright and bold.    Michele Catalano i like the old logo better, it was very classy and represented your company well. coming from a graphic designer's opinion, the new logo looks so 1990's. definately does not represent new and modern.    Karen Nadeau Barnes Hate it!! The old one looks Classy and the new one looks very cheap!    Jesse English My new Gap logo suggestion . pays homage to the heritage of our iconic blue box while plunging us forward with a modern aerial type and asymmetrical location inside the box. http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?fbid=595728528666&set=a.555566942806.2093951.57507900    NorthernCalifornia Drummer New Gap slogan for new logo: Your mom dresses you funny  just like our logo.     Irina Rudakov My GAP logo suggestion is pay for a good designer instead of crowdsourcing a new one.  , stop giving them FREE ideas you will NEVER be paid for!   Rocio Meza the logo is way too fuckin simple and it lacks creativity! Sh e on you gap Fix it!    Nic Fierro Helvetica is fine. But lose the gradient and position of the square and just put a period - Gap. It works: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1595251076563&set=a.1086379795099.2015734.1094534745    Enrique Kiki Perez Hi. I think my logo might be a good one.

As a designer myself, I find this extremely insulting. STOP GIVING THEM FREE IDEAS,  ! Get yourself out of your own mess, Gap.   Milee Gomez Por fin encontre la forma de c biar color a mi Facebook!

How do we share our own designs?    Jaime Lyons Here's a new Gap logo idea. A new twist on a classic brand. What do you think? http://spin350.com/spin350s-suggested-design-for-new-gap-logo/     Vasek Tommy My logo for Gap : http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/9910/gap.png   Diane Frazzette Loved the old design. Like the blue gradient representing shades of denim. Dislike its lack of simplicity. Logo should be fr ed. 2 rectangles offset, different shades of blue? Understand reasons for the new design. But there are plenty of more distinctive modern sans-serif fonts. (Even if you didn't pay for the new logo, you paid someone to choose it yikes!)    Antoinette Puddin Washington I want the old logo back.    Shannon Sergeant Pence I liked it the way it was. No change needed!    Terra Colley Old logo please    Shannon Sergeant Pence If it has worked for 20+ years why change it? It is classic.   Chrissy Grimes Norris The new logo looks generic and unimpressive. The old logo was sophisticated-looking. Bring the old logo back!     Monica Gonzalez You better ask for your money back to the creative te  who designed the new logo, you should have at least tested it first!     Papillon Johnston This new logo is horrible. As a Gap assosciate, I feel ash ed that we are turning our back on our original logo. The old logo is more than just a picture. It stands for everything that GAP is. If you have ever worked for this company you will know that it is an  azing company to work for. Its focus is on   and nobody (customers or employees) is just a number      Danielle    Kindberg    My personal opionion, the logo is plain. For being a grpahic artist for so many years, I would have choose something a little more trendy. Then again, why is there such a debate on the logo? As long as the clothing isnt changing, who cares what the tag looks like??!?    Chinwe Iroh THERE SHOULD BE A DISLIKE BUTTON BECAUSE THAT IS THE BUTTON I NEED TO CLICK FOR THE NEW LOGO SORRY BUT IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T TRY TO FIX IT. BRING BK THE OLD LOGO!!    Vinay Regis Bhola Do not change the log it looks awful. It look so dated. Your logo currently looks so timeless and elegant. Please do not change.     Darren Rinehart I like the new logo. Those that speak out strongly against it are the branding companies that are just angry they weren't paid to come up with it. I've seen many million dollar logos that look horrible. If you only paid $17 for it, I'm happy that will keep the cost of clothing down. Nice job, Gap!    Jacki Marshall-Ortiz yuck it looks like an off brand    Erika Sengbusch I like the current logo. Why change a good thing? The new one looks cheap, like a first year design student made it.    Adolfo Obando I just like the old logo    Ashanti Ward that is a horrible logo i   a huge gap fan is this is not a new logo its l e!!!!!!    Tasha Marie Stevens if you're going to change it, at least let the new one be an improvement.   Shantay Shahbaz Just saying, the new logo looks like it was made for a computer company in the 80's or something. Change it back, or get a better look. Please.

It wasn't your logo that needed changing it was the lack of innovation and outrageous prices. Your brand is known. What needs repositioning however is who you're marketing to, can't make profit if your prices don't match your target market.     Barbara Lima I agree k*I*S*S lol leave it alone it's fine the way it is  why the need to change it ?

Branding is sacred and costly. Most companies would kill for the kind of brand loyalty your customers have shown over the past few days. You would be insane to change.   Jorge Nieves Garbaaaaage!    Kara Bowers i definitely support a new logo but the one that you chose is so cheap looking  i'm not a designer and i could have created it. awful.   Erin Reilley New logo has no class.   John House Twenty years, huh? So how long has Levi's had the red tag logo? Seems to be working out for them but then again, their jeans last years over yours.   Madison Ostermeier Can't you just say   Fools! and change it back?      Linda Rakers you're an insurance company now ? really, the new logo has nothing to do with a fashion brand !!keep the old one, that's the signature everybody knows.   Mikhail Lukyanau With new ideas, congratulate you!    Sharon S pson First impressions are important - that logo will speak to whoever sees it. What is it saying? Nothing. The old logo was so great you can't go from that strong bold logo to the new one. It appears that zero time was spent coming up with it, which is not the what you want to communicate to your fans, loyal customers or possible customers.   S antha Baker please vote for my babies and let me know your kids id and i'll return the favor 196608 ans 194082 thanks you    Stacy Orem-Sweet The only right thing to do is go back to the old logo     Alvaro Acevedo Epic fail on the new logo. Made worse by trying to make it a crowd sourcing idea. Should have redone Old Navy logo and Do not mess with Banana Republic PLEASE!!!    Nicole Guillen HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE! please bring the old logo back! the new one is horrible and not classy at all! it looks so cheap, i just hate it!   Alex Hempton crowdsourcing the logo is silly     Ana Borich Bruskee, I like your design. You can clearly see that the log is updated, yet retains the essence of the brand. Nicely done.     Mine Pekkara Kayabay it looks like '' gap computer '' i don't like new one      Miri Dahan The old logo looks much more contemporary than the new one/ I love the elegance and simplicity. A perfect match to the clothes - good, reliable, upto date but can be worn several seasons.The new logo does not look like a logo at all. I did    Mark Anardun The old one is classic, iconic and instantly recognizable. The new one I wouldn't even connect that it was supposed to be the s e brand. The old one reminded me of several other major designers like Chanel, and Ralph Lauren. Obviously thos   Jacqueline Place It looks like a cheap clip art I used back when I was first learning about computers in First Grade! Leave it be.

Hire a real design firm to redesign your logo, but PLEASE don't resort to crowdsourcing. That's disgusting! You're the freakin' Gap! You got loads of money! Use it to pay for a new logo developed by industry professionals and trash this disgusting new logo that looks like someone's vomit.

Why change something that wasn't broke? The old logo Was Gap! You need to fire whomever designed this newest creation because it looks like something anything could have made with clip art on powerpoint! Please go back to the old design!    Kate Spencer Doak If I saw that new logo on clothing, I'd assume they were imitation gap (whatever that would be). The new logo looks like it is for a container shipping company. Just not artistic.    Debra Tregle Keep the old logo. Why change something that has worked for 20 years?    P  Holtz This logo is iconic if it ain't broke, don't fix it :)     Chew Wen Xuan Bad bad choice to even think of using it as a new logo. It's horrible! I think there's a huge communication gap between you and your designers. How did it even get shortlisted?     Dawn Tenorio I   so disappointed in this new logo! It shows no class and its a loser as far as I   concerned. No way will that emblem ever brandish a shirt I would wear. Please, you will lose your base customers. With this many customers taking the     Julie Chanslor The old logo is iconic, why on earth would you change it? What you SHOULD be working on is the quality of your clothing. GAP used to be my go to but I've been VERY disappointed with the quality in recent years. I have 3 or 4 pocket tees I   Jaime Eller Chi an The new Logo is terrible. I   a loyal Gap customer, and as a design student and PR professional, the new logo makes me physically sick. I would consider never coming into a gap store again if I had to look at that logo everytime I c e in. I don't want to look at it coming into a store, much less wear it on my body!    Tani Thomas Please! This is a brilliant ploy by the Gap marketing department to put a horrible logo out there, then use FaceBook to solicit Better Ideas from this social media outlet. Lo and behold, the news will report (free press for Gap) that th   Muh mad Aqeel like this!    Raymond Carlos Abagat Still hating this. For the record, the new logo looks like it's from a company that sells bathroom tiles.     Patrick Barkley You know where the Gap got their inspriation? Take a look at the Polaroid logo. S e font. S e little box, just in a different spot. Ugly!     Reuel Meditz I hate the new logo. Just don't change it.    Maverick Regret How about ironic html symbols for your logo? <b> GAP </b>     Maverick Regret how about:**BAD LOGO**it's daring. it's catchy.     Erika  ato I liked your page specifically to tell you how BAD your new logo is. It's absolutely awful. The old one is great, and you're complete idiots to change it - especially to something as cheap and generic looking as THAT. As many other consumers have commented, it's the declining quality of your product (and the recession) that is causing the downturn in your sales. NOT your logo.   Philippine Dubois EVERY FRENCH HATE THIS NEW LOGOA UGLY LOGO   Philippine Dubois why did you choose a crap logo?    Kellie Hoyle The changes needed to be made within the store .the logo doesn't do you any favors. It's just a tad cheap-looking and the old logo has been your staple and working for you for years. If you are having issues with bringing in customers lower your prices or add updated designs.   Lisa Hensley http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-better-gap-logo-community-project-54693/designers/472730#entry-2193    Erin Reilley Now that I think about it. The Gap is trying to sell me not just a product but an image. The new image is tacky. It will effect your bottom line. Consider selling $1.00 products that fits the new logo perfectly.   Ellen Peyser Kaplan do not like the new logo. Don't change it.     Erin Reilley Seriously you hired someone to create a bad logo so you could create a media flurry and get the logo from a customer. Really! Why does 20 years seem like a long time to you  . Tradition and age works for wine. If your advertising department was board. Tell them to go work at a soup kitchen.   Tom Mentzer Exactly WHO gave input on the new logo? Chimps? Freshman year design students? The Gap has had a hard enough time connecting with customers and staying relevant in recent years, ditching an iconic logo isn't going to help.   Tanil Raif the new logo is so simple ! a 2yr old can draw it :s it sucks   Yuval Tresser Benz, BMW, SONY, Levi's, Lacoste (who invented the concept of the clothing brand Logo), Chanel, Dior, macy*s, etc. all have logos that are older over 20 years old they did not try to lose their identity whenever, or if ever the going got    Daniel Brock Marka, please allow me to speak with you at your convenienceon my plans to help redesign your redesign. I think the current redesign is not successful. I've read your thoughts on the Huffington Post website and I'd like to help you achieve     Shannon Smith Mann I do not like the new logo. It is as if you are trying to be something you are not. GAP is a classy and classic clothing company and I like just the way it is. Please go back to the original logo! Change is not always a good. Like the saying goes if it isn't broke, don't fix it.     Shane Potvin I had a friend tell me the other day that Gap changed their logo, I hadn't seen it but I wanted to try to visualize what they would do with their brand as a next step. Before he showed it to me, I said, I'm assuming they used a more modern    K Gil-Del Rio goodness get over it!    Stephanie Rumbuc It's awful. Why in the world would you change it?     Isabel Dr'e9an It's terrible !!! DON'T CHANGE __ Why change when you have something good?     Jaime Lyons Opinions please. How does this idea compare with Gap's newly released logo? This is the one brand hierarchy I suggest: http://spin350.com/gap-brand-hierarchy/     Tom Mentzer In reading these comments, and knowing it's apparent no one likes the new logo, I know wonder if this is a clever stunt by Gap to get attention and engage the loyalists. If so, bravo. If not, it's just another bad idea to salvage a struggling brand.    Grah  Smith Here are a few thoughts behind my Helvetica variation of your new Helvetica based logohttp://dribbble.com/shots/64132    Diane Koro My guess is that a true graphic designer was never even consulted in this process, you probably pulled some computer progr mer from another department who has Photoshop on his CV or even worse, an administrative assistant. When will corporate  erican learn, just knowing Photoshop does NOT make a graphic designer!!!   Ji Lee tom raises a good point. this logo is sooooo bad that it must be a publicity stunt. floating square? helvetica? gap. making the unreal  real   Erick Akyo hey!! my idea! I design the font  http://twitpic.com/2w3i98     Erick Akyo great idea! ;D    Andr'e9 Torossian Keep the older one !!     Catherine Hancock Widdison Publicity stunt = troll irl.Ya'll got trolled.Plus, with everyone giving away free logo ideas Gap might snatch them up and not pay you for their new corporate identity. I'd hold onto your ideas until you know you'd get more than 15 minutes     Marcus Cruz what do crowds know? theyre mindless sheep! youre a brand leader, SO LEAD!    Mark Anthony My logohttp://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=44595&id=100000202450760&saved#!/photo.php?fbid=166208116729269&set=a.166208110062603.44595.100000202450760     Jane Beckler Bird OK I'm in! Got ideas already  why didn't you ask me in the first place? ;-)    CharlaAnne H ilton Sad sad day for GAP!!! Old logo is classic and should stay put!!!    Jaime Lyons If this is a publicity stunt Gap, I say great job. If it's not, I say great job. How ever you slice it, this was a great way to get   talking and using your facebook page. Fantastic. I enjoyed drafting the logos I submitted and participating. Hats off to your marketing folks.    Melanie Richardson Why change the logo? Look what happened to the coca cola company when they tried to change their product.    Herta Stephan I like it how is it or can be all in one like tunnel G- long A-little small P-smaller and don`t change the color they are  azing and its nice how is it, its very expressive and very proffesional    Charles Anderson The new Gap logo is actually quite hard to look at. First, it doesn't scale well on your website. It looks as though the font is pixilated. Second, it is straining my eyes and confusing the right eye due to the blue gradient filled box b    Cl'e9ment De Conto The new logo looks cheap, is that your new image that you want to convey? The old one has much more personnality.     Lindsay Powell definitely NOT a fan of this logo. the gap brand is supposed to be professional, respected .this new logo shows anything BUT that. it's cheap and headed in the wrong direction. c'mon gap, you can do so much better than this!!    Elaine Jiyo Won Keep the old logo, seriously. It's iconic - it's like changing the Golden Arches on McDonalds to a straight lined 'M' or changing the font of the Coca Cola brand. Keep what works.   Nicole Specht GRAPHIC DESIGNERS: Do not post redesigns of the Gap logo. Crowd-sourcing allows companies to ignore copywriting. We are professionals that deserve to be compensated adequately for the creative work done.     10    Zia Johnson I hope y'all didn't pay   to come up with the new logo. That logo is stupid, plain, and is an insult to the Gap brand. KEEP THE OLD LOGO. I don't see why we need change. Keep it classic. The old logo is an ICON, let it be such.   Nicole Specht DO THIS INSTEADhttp://blog.iso50.com/logos/gap-redesign-contest/   Rc Cortez why is it changed in the first place? will the new logo really turn gap as the coke of the clothing industry?   Nicole Specht DO THIS INSTEADhttp://blog.iso50.com/logos/gap-redesign-contest/    Charlotte Equality Jacobson I too liked your page specifically to tell you how BAD your new logo is. It's absolutely awful. The old one is great, and you're complete idiots to change it - especially to something as cheap and generic looking as THAT. As many other cons   Santiago Felippelli Dear Ms. Hansen and GAP te I imagine you have done a lot of work on this new rebranding project. In my opinion you new brand reflects some interesting values that GAP is translating as an experience but I feel this project still needs some    Arun Kumar S pathkumar http://crazymotts.blogspot.com/   Tiffany Wilson I   voting to keep the old logo. And trying to crowd source your logo is another bad idea. Read AIGA's stance on SPEC work. Good graphic designers don't work for free. They understand the value of what good design can do for your business.  Monika B. Paitl when companies have no other pr ideas to make their brand the talk of the town they do what? they change the logo. if they do so, they should at least improve it. the new gap logo is not inspired, dull and could be the logo of an insignificant electronics kind of company. what a missed opportunity!    Tricia Valadez Oh, she's good.   Cristina Urdaneta I really don't like the new logo, it looks like I made it myself on a word document! :S KEEP THE OLD LOGO!   Mike Klocke Way to go Gap! Use crowd sourcing to fix your terrible screwup of a logo. DBs.    Sophia Pe'f1a-Garza The new logo looks cheesy and cheap.  Bobby Hutchison Go back to the old design. Duh!   Bobby Hutchison Hahahaha: [W]e're thrilled to see passionate debates unfolding! Yeah. Right. You'd be thrilled if everyone loved it. They don't. It's an epic FAIL. It cracks me up when someone in d age control writes We're thrilled .! LOL LOL LOL.    VVel Gnuehc This new logo is unsophisticated, uncreative and looks very elemetary in design. It is boring and a step backwards from the old logo. It is not the logo that is the problem with the GAP, it is the clothing. I think there should be a new design te  brought in to refresh the designs ..the clothing selection has been boring for the past 10 years .    Nathan Dutton  Oh, so you think you can do better, eh? You say.Yeah. I do. But not without compensation. Every good designer says.Oh  You say. Nevermind.   Bri Menzies wow -   I the only one that thinks the old logo sucked? It did. It's old, and not a good old it's ugly serif caps on dark blue. I like what Shane Potvin did better than the new gap logo though. The one in small letters is best. Old logo    Patrick Veilleux First, the old logo was what we could call a logotype because the typo was the logo itself integrated in the square. The new one is kind of a mix between a signature and a logotype because the square is now the logo although it touches th   Jeremy Fretts New logo SUCKS. I   a design professional, and my professional opinion is that it looks like an  ateur powerpoint presentation.  Callie Drouin The new logo looks cheap.   Theresa Gallo okay, here is our suggestion: pay us thousands of dollars and we will recommend a new logo  Better yet, throw out the new logo and keep the original logo  It's like the old addage goes- if its not broken do not fix it  Therefore our vote is to keep the original logo- it's unique and it's ICONIC  .. what's wrong with you folks ..   Ale Gonzalez I completely hate the new logo! Whyyyyy???? It totally looks like a powerpoint design!   Ken O'Seven The new logo sticks, it reminds me of the old Microsoft Free Clip-art galleries. I can't believe this is happening.   Vonnie Currie Please bring back the classic GAP logo .the new one just doesn't work  Veronica Grapes The new logo is horrible! You are not a computer company! I love GAP and always look forward to getting a bag with the ORIGINAL logo on it. If you want to make GAP more innovative, bring in a new product, not a new logo which millions of   identify with.  Kimberley Parsons Walker New logo is awful!!!!!!!!!!! Fire the designer!  Jason Meyers Whoever green-lighted that logo should resign ASAP. It is an uninspired cheesy mess. I have been a lifelong GAP fan, but any garment with that logo on the label has no appeal to me whatsoever.  Simone Madoo Clearly majority votes for the old logo. I have to agree that this new logo is not as good. There is nothing better than the original, so keep it GAP officials!!!  Donna Marie Asking designers to re-design your logo through this spec work stunt is completely appalling and beyond unethical! You are blatantly DEVALUING an already devalued profession. I   boycotting Gap and all it's affiliates from here on out. You  Gerrard Harvey There is nothing original about the new logo and nothing smart/professional about it either (apart from the Helvetica font). Try reproducing this as a black and white logo and you'll see exactly what I mean. This logo must've been done by t  Gerrard Harvey By the way check out my ideas in my portfolio:http://99designs.com/ /gerrardharvey/folio?fbsource=folio  Kenneth Jung   so they are going to sell software now?  M aCaroline Marin I know I'm the Johnny Come Lately to this party, but that is a GOD AWFUL new logo. I really think it would change my image of the franchise negatively.  Kenneth Jung   Google Windows 2000 under images and you'll know what I mean  Kenneth Jung   protest this logo by reusing bags with the old logo, it does wonders for the environment!!!  Ant Mills   doesnt really matter what logo they use, still nobody will buy their clothing  Anna Firek Don't like new logo ;/  Peter Lea The blue square of the new logo looks cluttered and messy overlapping the 'p' like that. I believe it would be more appropriate used as a full stop, giving a more direct and striking look, 'e1 la: http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/design-better-gap-logo-community-project-54693/entries/  Grace Julian my gap logo redesignhttp://99designs.com/ /artist  Gina Wells Boyd If you've had the s e logo for half the existence of a company with no complaint or problem, the smart thing would be to stick with what   know and like. Maxwell House's cup still drips, Tide's logo still swirls, and Tommy Hilfiger still uses his flag.  Enrico Benintende Please, DO NOT change the logo. The one you are proposing now really looks like an insurance company.Don't change it just because you think you need to offer something new    y Puckett for those of you actually posting design alternatives for GAP, i'd encourage you to visit http://www.no-spec.com/ cheating yourself or another designer out of the fee that a multi-million dollar company like GAP can easily afford is just plain silly. why would you give away for a few pairs of khaki's what you could and should earn thousands of dollars for? i don't come to work everyday just for exposure, and neither should you.  Emma Dreher If it isn't broken, don't fix it. There was absolutely NOTHING wrong with the old logo, THIS my friends, is a public relations nightmare.  Mayette Ostonal The old logo is iconic - it's one of those logos that is so well known, if you used the s e blue background, s e white letters and font and used a brand n e other than GAP,   would say, Hey, they're stealing the GAP logo! But a   Alyssa Lee Welch How much money does your company makes and you are going to crowd source a bunch of designs for free from possibly hundreds of designers? Completely insulting to the industry, and to your designer as well. Gap has the money to either fix the logo or to just switch back and count it as a loss. Terrible.  Ocean Alexander http://www.no-spec.com/  Ocean Alexander http://www.no-spec.com/  Heather McAlendin The old logo is identifiable as the Gap brand it is an icon. Why would you re-brand now when millions of   are f iliar with it?  Rebecca Van den Bossche I don't like it at all!!!  Ann Bergsagel McPherson THE NEW LOGO IS HORRIBLE!! Glad to see the classic logo still on this FB site! I love the idea of a font change .but keep the navy blue rectangle!  Cassandra Pooh-ward Josey NO NEW LOGO!! the old one is a BRAND not just a N E !!!  Taylor Wyant everyone saying they hate the logo blah blah blaaah, it's not your company! the gap is a multi billion dollar company and even if   dont like the logo it doesn't really matter because their clothes are great quality and design. and even if   dont like the design its not like it's plastered on all their clothes! so suck it up and move on it's JUST a logo, its not like it'll affect your life. just like i hate the tim hortons logo but i still drink the coffee!";
